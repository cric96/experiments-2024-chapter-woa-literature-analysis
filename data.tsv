1	Cherchi G.; Manconi A.; Vargiu E.; Deledda D.	Text categorization using a Personalized, Adaptive, and Cooperative MultiAgent System	2005	In this paper, a multiagent system for supporting users in retrieving information from heterogeneous data sources, and classifying them according to users' personal preferences, is presented. The system is built upon PACMAS, a generic architecture that supports the implementation of Personalized, Adaptive, and Cooperative MultiAgent Systems. Preliminary tests have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in retrieving and classifying newspaper articles. Results show an avarage accuracy of about 80%.

PRACTIONIST: Implementing PRACTIcal reasONIng sySTems	2005	One of the best known approaches to the development of rational agents is the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) architecture. In this paper we propose a new framework, PRACTIONIST (PRACTIcal reasONIng sySTem), to support the development of BDI agents in Java (using JADE) with a Prolog belief base. In PRACTIONIST we adopt a goal-oriented approach with a clear separation between the deliberation and the means-ends reasoning, and then between the states of affairs to pursue and the way to do it. Besides, PRACTIONIST allows developers to implement agents that are able to reason about their beliefs and the other agents' beliefs, expressed by modal logic formulas. Our approach also includes a specific tool that provides the developer with the possibility to effectively monitor the components involved in the execution cycle of an agent.
	Roggero D.; Patrone F.; Mascardi V.	Designing and implementing electronic auctions in a multiagent system environment	2005	Agent-Mediated Electronic Commerce is gaining a wide consensus both from the academia and from the industry, since it provides the right abstractions, models and tools to face the challenges that electronic commerce raises. According to C.Sierra, e-commerce can be described as organization + mechanism + trust, where mechanism is concerned with the rules that govern the interaction among agents in such a way that certain properties can be guaranteed. This paper describes the design and implementation of a library of customizable agents for simulating auction mechanisms. The purpose of the library is to provide a support to the correct engineering of mechanisms in the e-commerce setting, by providing a flexible tool for the quick prototyping of realistic auctions to the auctions' developers. The auction mechanisms that are included in our library respect the Revenue Equivalence Theorem, one of the most important theorems of the formal theory of auctions.
	Fortino G.; Garro A.; Russo W.	A discrete-event simulation framework for the validation of agent-based and multi-agent systems	2005	Simulation of agent-based systems is an inherent requirement of the development process which provides developers with a powerful means to validate both agents' dynamic behavior and the agent system as a whole and investigate the implications of alternative architectures and coordination strategies. In this paper, we present a discrete-event simulation framework which supports the validation activity of agent-based and multiagent systems which are modeled and programmed as a set of event-driven agents by means of the Distilled StateCharts formalism and related programming tools. The simulation framework is equipped with a discrete-event simulation engine which provides support for the execution of agents by interleaving their events processing, the exchange of events among agents, the migration of agents, and the clustering of agents into agent servers interconnected by a logical network. Using this framework, an agent-based complex system can be easily validated and evaluated by defining a simulator program along with suitable test cases and performance measurements.
	Bouquet P.; Kuper G.; Zanobini S.	Asking and answering queries semantically	2005	In this paper we propose a new method, called SEMQUERY, for querying information sources whose data are organized according to different schemata. The method is based on the idea of semantic elicitation, namely a process which takes in input the structural part of a query (e.g. the XPath part of an XQuery) and returns an expression in a logical language which represent the meaning of the query in a form which ideally is independent from its original syntactic formulation. Since the same process of elicitation can be performed on any path of schemata used to organize data, the decision on whether there is any logical relation between a query and a path in the schema is made via logical reasoning.
	Costantini S.; Tocchio A.	Learning by knowledge exchange in logical agents	2005	In this paper we introduce a form of cooperation among agents based on exchanging sets of rules. In principle, the approach extends to agent societies a feature which is proper of human societies, i.e., the cultural transmission of abilities. However, acquiring knowledge from untrustworthy agents should be avoided, and the new knowledge should be evaluated according to its usefulness. After discussing the general principles of our approach, we present a prototypical implementation.
	Bergenti F.	Secure, trusted and privacy-aware interactions in large-scale multiagent systems	2005	One of the inherent problems of large-scale, open multiagent systems is the lack of mechanisms and tools to guarantee legally valid interactions. Agents are supposed to perform crucial tasks autonomously and on behalf of humans; however, (i) they are not legal persons on their own, and (ii) of a full legal corpus for the virtual world and its inhabitants is yet to come. Therefore, the ultimate responsible for the actions of an agent is its developer. In this paper we address an innovative model of interaction between agents that leads to an increase of the level of security and trust in privacy-aware, interaction-intensive multiagent systems. In particular, after a brief introduction, we focus in Section II on some common problems related to trust and security in real-world, liable interactions. In Section III, we address these problems and outline some abstractions that we use to guarantee a sound level of security and privacy-awareness in interactions with third-party (possibly unknown) agents, whether human or not. Then, in Section IV we describe the design of an API that we implemented to provide developers with a generalpurpose, reusable means to realize secure, trusted and privacyaware multiagent systems. To conclude, in Section V we briefly discuss our model and outline directions of future development.

Towards the interpretation of emergent spatial patterns through Go game: The case of forest population dynamics	2005	In this paper we present the preliminary results of an ongoing research that aims at supporting ecosystem management in the study of forest systems according to a distributed modeling and simulation approach. The Cellular Automata For Forest Ecosystems (CAFFE) project is an interdisciplinary research involving computer scientists of the Department of Computer Science, Systems and Communication of the University of Milano-Bicocca and urban planners, biologists and ecosystem managers of the System Research Department of Austrian Research Center (ARC). In particular, we focus here on the part of CAFFE project that concerns the design of a method to support the analysis step of simulations of forests according to a distributed approach (such as those based on Cellular Automata or Situated Multi-Agent Systems). To this aim an innovative analysis method inspired by the Chinese Go game is under design. The originality of the approach concerns the detection within system configurations of known patterns whose interpretations are well-known by expert Go players. In this paper, after a brief presentation of the CA-based model of forests, we focus first on the set of Go patterns that we currently studied, then we present some preliminary results on experiments we conducted to validate the proposed approach to spatial patterns interpretation.
	Baldoni M.; Boella G.; Van Der Torre L.	Social roles, from agents back to objects	2005	In this paper we introduce a new view on roles in Object Oriented programming languages. This view is based on an ontological analysis of roles and attributes to roles the following properties: first, a role is always associated not only with an object instance playing the role, but also to another object instance which constitutes the context of the role and which we call institution. Second, the definition of a role depends on the definition of the institution which constitutes its context. Third, this second property allows to endow players of roles with powers to modify the state of the institution and of the other roles of the same institution. As an example of this model of roles in Object Oriented programming languages, we introduce a role construct in Java. We interpret these three features of roles in Java as the fact that, first, roles are implemented as classes which can be instantiated only in presence of an instance of the player of the role and of an instance of the class representing the institution. Second, the definition of a class implementing a role is included in the class definition of the institution the role belongs to. Thirdly, powers are methods of roles which can access private fields and methods of the institution they belong to and of the other roles of the same institution.

ANEMONE - A network of multi-agent platforms for academic communities	2005	This paper presents ANEMONE, a multi-agent platforms network that provides services for the academic community implemented by using the JADE agent development framework. In particular, ANEMONE provides a set of services to support i) academic people in some of their recurrent activities (fix an appointment, organize a meeting and search documents on the Web, ii) students in getting information about courses and iii) information technology people (including students) in getting information on documents and people that may help them to solve their programming problems. Moreover, it also provides a set of system-oriented services for the management of agent platforms and services and for the realization of new types of service.
	Di Stefano A.; Santoro C.	Building semantic agents in eXAT	2005	This paper describes the FIPA-ACL semantics support provided by eXAT, an Erlang-based FIPA-compliant agent platform, developed by the authors, which uses the Erlang language to offer a complete environment for the realization of the behavioral, intelligent and social parts of an agent. eXAT agents can thus exploit a FSM-based abstraction for the behavioral part and an Erlang-based rule processing engine (with its own knowledge base) for the implementation of agent's reasoning process. In this architecture, a SL Semantics Layer is introduced to support FIPA-ACL semantics; such a module is activated during messaging and is able to automatically check and perform the feasibility precondition and rational effect relevant to the communicative act sent or received. This is performed by manipulating the knowledge base of the inference engines of the sender/receiver agent, by checking for the presence of suitable facts and/or asserting other facts, according to FIPAACL semantics specification. ACL semantics handling is also enriched with a reasoning module, charged with the task of providing an "higher-level" messaging, based on agent actions-rather than messages-that, after a semantics-aware reasoning process, are transformed into communicative acts.
1	Mascardi V.; Demergasso D.; Ancona D.	Languages for programming BDI-style agents: An overview	2005	The notion of an intelligent agent as an entity which appears to be the subject of mental attitudes like beliefs, desires and intentions (hence, the BDI acronym) is well known and accepted by many researchers. Besides the definition of various BDI logics, many languages and integrated environments for programming BDI-style agents have been proposed since the early nineties. In this reasoned bibliography, nine languages and implemented systems, namely PRS, dMARS, JACK, JAM, Jadex, AgentSpeak(L), 3APL, Dribble, and Coo-BDI, are discussed and compared. References to other systems and languages based on the BDI model are also provided, as well as pointers to surveys dealing with related topics.
1	Gardelli L.; Viroli M.; Omicini A.	On the role of simulation in the engineering of self-organising systems: Detecting abnormal behaviour in MAS	2005	The intrinsic complexity of self-organising multiagent systems calls for the use of formal methods to predict global system evolutions at early stages of the design process. In particular, we evaluate the use of simulations of high-level system models to analyse properties of a design, which can anticipate the detection of wrong design choices and the tuning of system parameters, so as to rapidly converge to given overall requirements and performance factors. We take abnormal behaviour detection as a case, and devise an architecture inspired by principles from human immune systems. This is based on the TuCSoN infrastructure, which provides agents with an environment of artefacts-most notably coordination artefacts and agent coordination contexts. We then use stochastic π-calculus for specifying and running quantitative, large-scale simulations, which allow us to verify the basic applicability of our ID and obtain a preliminary set of its main working parameters.
	Giordano L.; Martelli A.; Terenziani P.; Bottrighi A.; Montani S.	A temporal approach to the specification and verification of interaction protocols	2005	The paper presents a proposal for the specification and verification of systems of communicating agents in a temporal logic. The proposal is based on a social approach to agent communication, where communication is described in terms of changes to the social state, and interaction protocols are defined by a set of temporal constraints, which specify the effects and preconditions of the communicative actions on the social state. The paper addresses the problem of combining protocols to define new more specialized protocols and exploits this idea in the specification of clinical guidelines.
1	Mamei M.; Zambonelli F.	Pervasive pheromone-based interaction with RFID tags	2005	Despite the growing interest in pheromone-based interaction to enforce adaptive and context-aware coordination, the number of deployed systems exploiting digital pheromones to coordinate the activities of application agents is very limited. In this paper, we present a real-world, low-cost and general-purpose, implementation of pheromone-based interaction. This is realized by making use of RFID tags to store digital pheromones, and by having humans and robots to spread/sense pheromones by properly writing/reading RFID tags populating the surrounding environments. We exemplify and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach via an application for object-tracking. This application allows robots and humans to find "forgot-somewhere" objects by following pheromones trails associated with them. In addition, we sketch further potential applications of our approach in pervasive computing scenarios.
1	Bandini S.; Federici M.L.; Vizzari G.	A methodology for crowd modelling with Situated Cellular Agents	2005	This paper introduces a research activity aimed at the definition of a methodology to provide a solid conceptual framework for the development of simulation systems focused on crowd dynamics and based on the Situated Cellular Agent (SCA) model. After a brief introduction of the SCA Model, the general methodological approach is described. The main steps provide the definition of the spatial abstraction of the environment, the definition of its active elements, and the specification of types of mobile agents, the related behaviours with particular attention to their movement by means of the notion of utility. A case study is also briefly described in order to show how the methodology was applied in the modelling of crowd behaviour in a subway station.
	Bryl V.; Giorgini P.; Fante S.	An implemented prototype of Bluetooth-based multi-agent system	2005	People tend to form social networks within specific geographical areas. This is motivated by the fact that the geographical locality corresponds generally to common interests and opportunities offered by the people active in the area (e.g. students of a university could be interested to buy or sell textbooks adopted for a specific course, to share notes, or just to meet together to play basketball). Cellular phones and more in general mobile devices are currently widely used and represent a big opportunity to support social communities. We present an application of multi-agent systems accessible via mobile devices (cellular phones and PDAs), where Bluetooth technology has been adopted to reflect users locality. We illustrate an implemented prototype of the proposed architecture and we discuss the opportunities offered by the system.
	Corradini F.; Culmone R.; Di Berardini M.R.; Merelli E.	Integrating ontologies in mobile agents	2005	The process of information extraction and data integration in a global information system demands automatic techniques for quickly determining semantic similarity among concepts across different ontologies. This paper presents a graph based approach for computing, on-the-fly, semantic similarities among ontologies of a specific domain. The approach consists of integrating mobile agents and ontologies to support a variety of applications in distributed environments. The resulting technique is illustrated on Hermes, agent-based middleware for mobile computing, by an example in molecular biology domain.

	Cabri G.; Ferrari L.; Leonardi L.; Quitadamo R.	Improving Aglets with strong agent mobility through the IBM JikesRVM	2005	Agents are problem-solving entities that, thanks to characteristics such as autonomy, reactivity, proactivity and sociality, together with mobility, can be used to develop complex and distributed systems. In particular, mobility enables agents to migrate among several hosts, becoming active entities of networks. Java is today one of the most exploited languages to build mobile agent systems, thanks to its object-oriented support, portability and network facilities. Nevertheless, Java does not support strong mobility, i.e., the mobility of threads along with their execution state; thus developers cannot develop agents as real mobile entities. This paper reports our approach for Java thread strong migration, based on the IBM Jikes Research Virtual Machine, presenting our results and proposing an enrichment of the Aglets mobile agent platform in order to exploit strong agent mobility.
	Chesani F.; Ciampolini A.; Mello P.; Montali M.; Torroni P.; Alberti M.; Storari S.	Protocol specification and verification by using computational logic	2005	The aim of this paper is to report on some preliminary results obtained in the context of the MASSIVE research project (http://www.di.unito.it/massive/) relating the formal specification and verification of protocols in some different application field. A protocol is a way to express the right behavior of entities involved in a (possibly complex and distributed) process. The formalism to be used for protocol description should be as intuitive as possible, but it should be also formally defined, in order to allow formal checks both on the features of the protocol itself (e.g. termination), and also on the execution of it. To this purpose, we will show some results obtained by exploiting the SOCS - SI logic-based framework for the specification and the verification of protocols in various applicative fields such as electronic commerce, medicine and e-learning. We will also present a new graphical notation to express medical guidelines, which could be automatically translated into the SOCS formalism.
	Armano G.; Cherchi G.; Manconi A.; Vargiu E.	PACMAS: A Personalized, Adaptive, and Cooperative MultiAgent System architecture	2005	In this paper, a generic architecture, designed to support the implementation of applications aimed at managing information among different and heterogeneous sources, is presented. Information is filtered and organized according to personal interests explicitly stated by the user. User profiles are improved and refined throughout time by suitable adaptation techniques. The overall architecture has been called PACMAS, being a support for implementing Personalized, Adaptive, and Cooperative MultiAgent Systems. PACMAS agents are autonomous and flexible, and can be made personal, adaptive and cooperative, depending on the given application. The peculiarities of the architecture are highlighted by illustrating three relevant case studies focused on giving a support to undergraduate and graduate students, on predicting protein secondary structure, and on classifying newspaper articles, respectively.
	Cordì V.; Lombardi P.; Martelli M.; Mascardi V.	An ontology-based similarity between sets of concepts	2005	To help sharing knowledge in those contexts where documents and services are annotated with semantic information, such as the Semantic Web, defining and implementing the similarity between sets of concepts belonging to a common ontology may prove very useful. In fact, if both the required and the provided pieces of information (be they textual documents, services, images, or whatever) are annotated with sets of concepts taken from a reference ontology O, the evaluation of how good a piece of information P is, w.r.t. the required one R, may be based on the similarity between the two sets of concepts that describe P and R. One of the first applications of the agent technology, aimed at "reducing work and information overload", was that of retrieving and filtering information in an automatic way. Thus, the possibility to calculate the semantic distance between two sets of concepts finds a natural application in the agent field, in particular for improving those agents that act as "digital butlers" for their human owners, by exploring the Semantic Web and looking for useful documents and/or services. Unfortunately, the metrics for calculating the semantic distance between two sets of concepts that can be found in the literature, are often very simple and do not meet some requirements that, up to us, make the metric closer to the common sense reasoning. For this reason, we have designed and implemented two new algorithms for computing the similarity between sets of concepts belonging to the same ontology.
	Cabitza F.; Locatelli M.P.; Sarini M.	CASMAS: An agent-based support for modulated participation in cooperative applications	2005	This paper proposes CASMAS: an agent-based model to design an environment of collaborative applications by taking into account the notion of community. Within this model, communities are characterized by declarative rules that express and shape the participative behavior of the community members. The degree of participation of each member can dynamically change according to her physical location and her position in the logical space of the applications used within the community. The paper shows how this approach can facilitate the design of collaborative applications that are community-aware, that is augmented with mechanisms by which to manage different levels of participation of the community members.

Personalization, verification and conformance for logic-based communicating agents	2005	This paper is an overview of the work that we have carried on in the last two years in the context of the MASSiVE project. The main research lines have concerned personalization of the interaction with web services, personalization of courseware, web services interoperability, and integrated environments for agent oriented software engineering. All of them can be seen as applications of different reasoning techniques to a declarative specification of interaction. A declarative specification makes the study of properties easy and allows a fast prototyping of applications. In particular, we applied reasoning about actions and change to the personalized selection and composition of web services and to the construction of courseware that satisfies the user's needs and goals. This kind of reasoning has also been integrated in the DCaseLP MAS prototyping environment. Declarative specifications have also been helpful to face the problem of proving policy conformance in a way that guarantees web service interoperability. Finally, the adoption of process languages for web services for expressing the procedural behavior of adaptive BDI-style agents have been explored.
1	De Mola F.; Quitadamo R.	Towards an agent model for future autonomic communications	2006	The continuous growth in ubiquitous and mobile network connectivity, together with the increasing number of networked computational devices populating our everyday environments (e.g., PDAs, sensor networks, tags, etc.), call for a deep rethinking of traditional communication and service architectures. The emerging area of autonomic communication addresses such challenging issues by trying to identify novel flexible network architectures, and by conceiving novel conceptual and practical tools for the design, development, and execution of "autonomic" (i.e., self-organizing, self-adaptive and context-aware) communication services. In this paper, after having introduced the general concepts behind autonomic communications and autonomic communication services, we analyze the key issues related to the identification of suitable "component" models for autonomic communication services, and discuss the strict relation between such models and agent models. On this basis, we try to synthesize the key desirable characteristics that one should expect from a general-purpose agent model for autonomic communication services.

A multidimensional flocking algorithm for clustering spatial data	2006	In this paper, we describe the efficient implementation of M-Sparrow, an adaptive flocking algorithm based on the biology-inspired paradigm of a flock of birds. We extended the classical flock model of Reynolds with two new characteristics: the movement in a multi-dimensional space and different kinds of birds. The birds, in this context, are used to discovery point having some desired characteristics in a multidimensional space. A critical point of the algorithm is the efficient search of the k-neighbors in a multidimensional space. This search was efficiently implemented using the ANN libraries.

SimpA-WS: An agent-oriented computing technology forWS-based SOA applications	2006	This document briefly describes simpA-WS, a Java-based agent-oriented computing technology to flexibly and effectively implement WS-I compliant SOA/WS applications - i.e. Web-Service applications with a Service-Oriented Architecture - both on the user side and the service side.
	Federici M.L.; Redaelli S.; Vizzari G.	Models, abstractions and phases in Multi-Agent Based Simulation	2006	This paper introduces some considerations about simulation practice and a schema of the models that are implicitly and explicitly involved in a Multi-Agent Based Simulation (MABS). The aim of this work is to set simulation inside scientific framework. In order to do that we give an interpretation of the levels that compound a simulation and that constitute different kinds of abstraction. A clear awareness of the relations that exist between these levels and the corresponding steps, in fact, it is necessary if MABS wants to be adopted as a scientific investigation method. Our opinion is that this analysis suggests some answers to the objections that are often directed towards the use of simulation in scientific practice but also underlines some criticalities in this process.
	Garro A.; Iusi M.	Software agents for learning Nash Equilibria in non-cooperative games	2006	This paper describes SALENE, a Multi Agent System (MAS) for learning Nash Equilibria in non-cooperative games. SALENE is based on the following assumptions: if agents representing the players act as rational players, i.e. they act to maximise their expected utility in each match of a game, and if such agents play k matches of the game they will converge in playing one of the Nash Equilibria of the game. SALENE can be conceived as a heuristic and efficient method to compute at least one Nash Equilibria in a non-cooperative game represented in its normal form.
1	Seidita V.; Cossentino M.; Gaglio S.	A repository of fragments for agent systems design	2006	The creation of a new design process for a specific situation using the method engineering approach is based on the composition of a set of reusable method fragments. The request for these reusable method fragments leads to the need for a repository containing standardized fragments that can be easily selected and assembled in new design processes. In this work we present a definition of method fragment coming from the work of the FIPA Technical Committee Methodology and a repository where fragments are classified according to the specific process component (activity, process role, and work product) they underpin and on the specific MAS Metamodel element(s) they work on.
	Sguera S.; Stellato A.; Griesi D.; Pazienza M.T.	J-ALINAs: A JADE-based Architecture for LINguistic agents	2006	In this paper we present J-ALINAs, a JADE-based Architecture for LINguistic Agents. The purpose of this architecture is to support communication between agents whose beliefs and intentions are driven by different, heterogeneous, knowledge models. This objective, often referred in literature as semantic coordination, can be carried on through the identification of specific agent roles and behaviors dedicated to the mediation of agents' knowledge. In particular, such minimal hypotheses suggest an intelligent exploitation of natural language based technologies (resources and systems) as a necessary choice for capturing those similarities between the different knowledge models of agents trying to communicate, which are not in any way formally ratified. We aim to provide a flexible framework to be adopted in open multi-agent environments across different scenarios, providing a further abstraction level from the underlying details related to specific semantic coordination approaches; a high-cohesion and low-coupling design, and an agent-interaction protocol make possible for the architecture to face non-ideal use cases optimizing the communications among the agents. We discuss significant design issues, provide a prototypical implementation based on the JADE platform and a case study - MAPLE - integrating an ontology mapping component in the framework, showing flexibility of the architecture in real applications and its independence from any specific mapping algorithm. Finally we will look at the semantic coordination protocol we designed from a strictly formal perspective, providing a CCS (Milner's Calculus for Communicating Systems) description of the protocol itself.
1	Oliva E.; Viroli M.; Omicini A.	Minority Game: A logic-based approach in TuCSoN	2006	Minority Game is receiving an increasing interest because it models emergent properties of complex systems including rational entities, such as for instance the evolution of financial markets. As such, Minority Game provides for a simple yet stimulating scenario for system simulation. In this paper, we aim at presenting a logic approach to the Minority Game whose goal is to overcome the well-known limits of the equation model in the verification of the system behaviour. We realise the social system simulation using a novel MAS meta-model based on agents and artifacts, where the agent rationality is obtained using a BDI architecture. To this end, we adopt the TuCSoN infrastructure for agent coordination, and its logic-based tuple centre abstractions Abstract: artifact representatives. By implementing Minority Game over TuCSoN, we show some of the benefits of the artifact model in terms of flexibility and controllability of the simulation. A number of parameters can affect the behaviour of Minority Game simulation: such parameters are explicitly represented in the coordination artifact, so that they can be tuned up during the simulation. In particular, experiments are shown where memory size and number of wrong moves are adopted as the tuning parameters.
	Sabatucci L.; Cossentino M.; Gaglio S.	Building agents with agents and patterns	2006	The use of design patterns proved successful in lowering the development time and number of errors when producing software with the object-oriented paradigm. Now the need for a reuse technique is occurring for the emergent agent paradigm, for which a great effort is currently spending in methodology definitions. In this work we present our experiences in the identification, description, production and use of agents patterns. A repository of patterns was enriched during these years so to request a classification criteria and a documentation template useful to help user during the selection. Index Terms - Multiagent systems, patterns, reuse models and tools.
	Costantini S.; Dell'Acqua P.; Tocchio A.	Expressing preferences declaratively in logic-based agent languages	2006	In this paper we present an approach to introducing preferences among actions in logic-based agent-oriented languages. These preferences are expressed in the body of rules (i.e., they are local to the rule where they are defined). To the best of our knowledge, no similar approach has been proposed before, and cannot be easily simulated by means of preferences expressed in the head of rules, which are global. The approach is applied to choosing which action an agent should perform in reaction to an event, among the feasible ones.
1	Bicocchi N.; Mamei M.; Zambonelli F.	Mechanisms of self-organization in pervasive computing	2006	The mass deployment of sensors and pervasive computing systems expected in the next few years, will require novel approaches to program and gather information from such systems. Suitable approaches will be general purpose, independent of a specific scenario and sensor deployment, and able to adapt autonomically to different scales and to a number of unforeseen circumstances. This paper focuses on the requirements and issues of upcoming pervasive computing scenario, and surveys current research initiatives to deal with them. In particular researches addressing data retrieval and aggregation, macro-programming, and data integration in pervasive computing infrastructures will be detailed. Overall, the paper illustrates our ideas on collecting information from both sensor systems and Web resources and on linking them together in overlay knowledge network offering applications comprehensive and understandable information about their computational environment.
	Bartocci E.; Corradini F.; Merelli E.	Building a MultiAgent System from a User Workflow Specification	2006	This paper provides a methodology to build a MultiAgent System (MAS) described in terms of interactive components from a domain-specific User Workflow Specification (UWS). We use a Petri nets-based notation to describe workflow specifications. This, besides using a familiar and well-studied notation, guarantees an highlevel of description and independence with more concrete vendor-specific process definition languages. In order to bridge the gap between workflow specifications and MASs, we exploit other intermediate Petri nets-based notations. Transformation rules are given to translate a notation to another. The generated agent-based application implements the original workflow specification. Run-time support is provided by a middleware suitable for the execution of the generated code.
	Baldoni M.; Boella G.; Van Der Torre L.	Importing agent-like interaction in object orientation	2006	This paper begins with the comparison of the message-sending mechanism, for communication among agents, and the method-invocation mechanism, for communication among objects. Then, we describe an extension of the methodinvocation mechanism by introducing the notion of "sender" of a message, "state" of the interaction and "protocol" using the notion of "role", as it has been introduced in the powerJava extension of Java. The use of roles in communication is shown by means of an example of protocol.

	Fortino G.; Garro A.; Russo W.	Distributed workflow enactment: An agent-based framework	2006	This paper describes the design and the implementation of an Agent-based Workflow Enactment Framework (AWEF) which can be instantiated on the basis of a workflow schema for obtaining a specific workflow enactment engine. A workflow engine therefore is a MAS capable of managing instances of the workflow schema used for the instantiation of AWEF. Each MAS adopts a hierarchical organizational structure composed by an EnacterAgent, which is responsible of the activation and monitoring of the workflow, one or more ManagerAgents, which are responsible of the execution and control of the workflow/subworkflows according to a parent/child model, and one or more TaskAgents, which are responsible of the execution of internal tasks and/or of the wrapping of external tasks or services. The hierarchical distribution of the workflow execution control between the ManagerAgents and the distribution of the computation among the TaskAgents allow for more flexible, efficient, and robust enactment services.
	Garruzzo S.; Rosaci D.; Sarné G.M.L.	MAST: An agent framework to support B2C E-commerce	2006	In this paper we present an XML-based multi-agent system, called Multi Agent System for Traders (MAST), that completely supports Business-to-Customer E-commerce activities, including advertisements and payments. MAST helps both customers and merchants in their tasks with a homogeneous and personalized approach. In particular, E-payments in MAST are implemented under the availability of financial institutions. This avoids exchanging of sensible customers' information and reinforces the confidence between customers and merchants. A complete prototype of MAST has been implemented in the JADE framework, and it has been exploited for realizing some experiments, in order to evaluate its performances.

Simulation of minority game in TuCSoN	2006	Minority Game (MG) is a mathematical model that takes inspiration from the “El Farol Bar” problem introduced by Brian Arthur (1). It is based on a simple scenario where at each step a set of agents perform a boolean vote which conceptually splits them in two classes: the agents in the smaller class win. In this game, a rational agent keeps track of previous votes and victories, and has the goal of winning throughout the steps of the game—for which a rational strategy has to be figured out. One of the most important applications of MG is in the market models: (2) use MG as a coarse-grained model for f inancial markets to study their fluctuation phenomena and statistical properties. Even though the model is coarse-grained and provides an over-simplified micro-scale description, it anyway captures the most relevant features of system interaction, and generates collective properties that are quite similar to those of the real system. Another point of view, presented e.g. by (3), considers the MGasapoint in space of a Resource Allocation Game (RAG). In this work a generalisation of MG is presented that relaxes the constraints on the number of resources, studying how the system behaves within a given range. MG can be considered a social simulation that aims to reproduce a simplified human scenario. In principle, a logic-based approach based on BDI agent makes it easier to explicitly model a variety of diverse social behaviours. As showed by (4), a multiagent system (MAS) can be used to realise a MG simulation—there, BDI agents provide for rationality and planning. An agent-based simulation is particularly useful when the simulated systems include autonomous entities that are diverse, thus making it difficult to exploit the traditional framework of mathematical equations. In order to implement MG simulations we adopt the TuCSoN infrastructure for agent coordination (5), which introduces tuple centres as artifact representatives. A tuple centre is a programmable coordination medium living in the MAS environment, used by agents interacting by exchanging tuples (logic tuples in the case of TuCSoN logic tuple centres). As we are not concerned much with the mere issues of agent intelligence, we rely here on a weak form of rationality, through logic-based agents adopting pre-compiled plans called operating instructions (6).

PRACTIONIST: A framework for developing BDI agent systems	2006	A PRACTIONIST agent is a software component endowed with the following elements (figure 2): • aset of perceptions and the corresponding perceptors that listen to some relevant external stimuli; • a set of beliefs representing the information the agent has got about both its internal state and the external environment; • a set of goals the agent wishes or wants to pursue. They represent some states of affairs to bring about or activities to perform and will be related to either its desires or intentions (see below); • a set of goal relations the agent uses during the deliberation process and means-ends reasoning; • aset of plans that are the means to achieve its intentions; • a set of actions the agent can perform to act over its environment; and • a set of effectors that actually execute the actions. As shown in figure 2, PRACTIONIST agents are structured in two main layers: the framework defines the execution logic and provides the built-in components according to such a logic, while the top layer includes the specific agent components to be implemented, in order to satisfy system requirements.
	Castelli G.; Mamei A.R.M.; Zambonelli F.	The W4 model and infrastructure for contextaware browsing the world	2006	The imminent mass deployment of pervasive computing technologies such as sensor networks and RFID tags, together with the increasing participation of the Web community in feeding geo-located information within tools such as Google Earth, will soon make available an incredible amount of information about the physical and social worlds and their processes. This opens up the possibility of exploiting all such information for the provisioning of pervasive context-aware services for "browsing the world", i.e., for facilitating users in gathering information about the world, interacting with it, and understanding it. However, for this to occur, proper models and infrastructures must be developed. In this paper we propose a simple model for the representation of contextual information, the design and implementation of a general infrastructure for browsing the world, as well as some exemplar services we have implemented over it.
	Vecchiola C.; Grosso A.; Boccalatte A.	Integrating ontology support within AgentService	2006	This paper describes the software infrastructure introduced within the AgentService framework in order to provide support for ontology design, development, and management. Ontology enriches and normalizes the interaction among agents by establishing a domain and a set of relation among objects populating that domain. A good support for ontology definitely adds value to the design and the implementation of software agents: software engineers can take advantages of the servicesoffered by the framework to produce new ontologies and rely on them to quickly define interaction protocols which are automatically translated into state machines used by software agents.
	Bergenti F.; Lazzari L.; Poggi A.	Agent-based virtual communities for Interactive Digital Television	2006	This paper describes a multi-agent framework designed to support the creation and effective management of virtual communities in an Interactive Digital Television (IDTV) scenario. The possibilities that this framework offers are demonstrated by means of two sample applications: a real-time community game and an asynchronous auction. For the sake of completeness, the paper also presents an overview of IDTV technologies.
1	Bonomi A.; Vizzari G.; Sarini M.	A heterogeneous multi-agent system for adaptive web applications	2006	A web site presents an intrinsic graph-like spatial structure composed of pages connected by hyperlinks. This structure may represent an environment in which agents related to visitors of the web site are positioned and moved in order to track their navigation. To consider this structure and to keep track of these movements allows the monitoring of the site and of its visitors, in order to support the enhancement of the site itself through forms of adaptivity, carried out by specific interface agents. This paper presents a heterogeneous multiagent system supporting the collection of information related to user's behaviour in a web site by specific situated reactive agents. The acquired information is then exploited by an application supporting the proposal of hyperlinks based on the history of user's movement in the web site environment.
	Morreale V.; Bonura S.; Francaviglia G.; Centineo F.; Cossentino M.; Gaglio S.	Reasoning about goals in BDI agents: The PRACTIONIST framework	2006	The representation of goals and the ability to reason about them play an important role in goal-oriented requirements analysis and modelling techniques, especially in agent-oriented software engineering. Moreover goals are more useful and stable abstractions than others (e.g. user stories) in the analysis and design of software applications. Thus, the PRACTIONIST framework supports a goal-oriented approach for developing agent systems according to the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model. In this paper we describe the goal model of PRACTIONIST agents, in terms of the general structure and the relations amonggoals. Furthermore we show how PRACTIONIST agents use their goal model to reason about goals during their deliberation process and means-ends reasoning as well as while performing their activities.
1	Casadei M.; Gardelli L.; Viroli M.	Collective sorting tuple spaces	2006	Coordination of multiagent systems is recently moving towards the application of techniques coming from the research context of complex systems: adaptivity and self-organisation are exploited in order to tackle openness, dynamism and unpredictability of typical multiagent systems applications. In this paper we focus on a coordination problem called collective sorting, where autonomous agents are assigned the task of moving tuples across different tuple spaces according to local criteria, resulting in the emergence of the complete clustering property. Using a library we developed for the MAUDE term rewriting system, we simulate the behaviour of this system and evaluate some solutions to this problem.
	Bossa S.; Fiumara G.; Provetti A.	A lightweight architecture for RSS polling of arbitrary Web sources	2006	We describe a new Web service architecture designed to make it possible to collect data from traditional plain HTML Web sites, aggregate and serve them in more advanced formats, e.g. as RSS feeds. To locate the relevant data in the plain HTML pages, the architecture requires the insertion of some meta tags in the commented text. Hence, the extra markup remains totally transparent to users and programs. Such annotated HTML documents are then routinely pulled by our Web service, which then aggregates the data and serves them over several channels, e.g. RSS 1.0 or 2.0. Also, a REST-style Web Service allows users to submit XQuery queries to the feeds database. Finally, we discuss scalability issues w.r.t. polling frequencies.
	Baldoni M.; Baroglio C.; Martelli A.; Patti V.	Conformance and interoperability in open enviroments	2006	An important issue, in open environments like the web, is guaranteeing the interoperability of a set of services. When the interaction scheme that the services should follow is given (e.g. as a choreography or as an interaction protocol), it becomes possible to verify, before the interaction takes place, if the interactive behavior of a service (e.g. a BPEL process specification) respects it. This verification is known as "conformance test". Recently some attempts have been done for defining conformance tests w.r.t. a protocol but these approaches fail in capturing the very nature of interoperability, turning out to be too restrictive. In this work we give a representation of protocol, based on message exchange and on finite state automata, and we focus on those properties that are essential to the verification the interoperability of a set of services. In particular, we define a conformance test that can guarantee, a priori, the interoperability of a set of services by verifying properties of the single service against the protocol. This is particularly relevant in open environments, where services are identified and composed on demand and dynamically, and the system as a whole cannot be analyzed.
	Messina F.; Novelli G.; Pappalardo G.; Santoro C.; Tramontana E.	A QoS-aware architecture for multimedia content provisioning in a Grid environment	2006	In this paper, we propose a mobile agent infrastructure to support "Quality of Service" (QoS) parameters in multimedia content streaming. The infrastructure is able to face the issues concerning multimedia content transformation, in order to ensure that the client-side QoS is met. A Grid computing platform is exploited and content adaptation is performed through appropriate agents that are allocated as jobs and executed on Grid hosts. A location service is therefore devised and made available within the Grid system, which helps finding the hosts whose geographic position and network connections minimise the delays required to move the desired multimedia content from the storage to the processing site, and (after suitable transcoding) from this to the requesting client.

Model driven design and implementation of activity-based applications in Hermes	2006	Hermes is an agent-based middleware structured as a component-based and 3-layered software architecture. Hermes provides an integrated, flexible programming environment for design and execution of activity-based applications in distributed environments. By using workflow technology, it supports even a non expert user programmer in the model driven design and implementation of a domain specific application. In this paper, after a description of Hermes software architecture, we provide a simple demo in biological domain and we show some real case studies in which Hermes has been validated.
	Nicosia V.; Spampinato C.; Santoro C.	Software agents for autonomous robots: The eurobot 2006 experience	2006	Agent-based software architectures have been used and exploited in many application fields. In this paper, we report our experience about using intelligent agents for an unusual task: controlling an autonomous robot playing a kind of "golf" game in an international robotic competition. Driving a real robot is a practical application field for software agents, because different subsystems need to be controlled and synchronised in order to realize a global game strategy: cooperating agents can easily fit the target. Since this application requires a soft real-time platform to guarantee fast and reliable actions, and also a valuable communication system to gain feedback from sensors and to issue commands to actuators, we chose Erlang as programming language. A two-layer multi-agent system was thus designed and realized, composed of a lower layer, hosting agents taking care of the interface with sensors and actuators, and a higher layer, where agents are in charge of "intelligent" activities related to game strategy.
	Baldoni M.; Boella G.; Van Der Torre L.	Adding roles to relationship patterns	2007	In this paper we study how roles can be added to patterns modelling relationships in Object Oriented programming, and which new relationship patterns can be introduced using roles. Relationships can be introduced in programming languages either by reducing them to attributes of the objects which participate in the relationship, or by modelling the relationship itself as a class whose instances have the participants of the relationships among their attributes. However, even if roles have been recognized as an essential component of relationships, also in modelling languages like UML, they have not been introduced in Object Oriented programming when it is necessary to model relationships. Introducing roles allows to add attributes and behaviors to the participants in the relationship, rather than to the relationship itself, and to distinguish natural types as classes participating in the relationships from the roles the participants acquire in the relationships. In this paper we show how the role model proposed in powerJava can be used to endow relationships with roles, both in the relationship as attribute and in the relationship object pattern. Finally, since these patterns have different advantages and limitations, we propose a third pattern based on roles which benefits from the advantages of the two previous patterns when modelling relationships.

A framework for execution and visualization of situated agents based virtual environments	2007	This document briefly describes a framework supporting the definition and implementation of virtual environment inhabited by interacting situated agents defined according to the Multilayered Multi-Agent Situated System model. The framework supports the specification and execution of visually rich 3D virtual environment endowed by the presence of mobile agents acting and interacting inside it according to a multi-agent model.
	Ricci A.; Denti E.	Simpa-WS: A simple agent-oriented programming model & technology for developing SOA & Web Services	2007	Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is more and more recognised by the industry as the reference blueprint for building inter-operable, distributed enterprise applications based on open standards such as Web Services (WS). In the current state-of-the-art, the programming models for engineering SOA systems proposed by the leading industries are essentially component-based - typically, rooted in object-oriented abstractions and technologies. On the side, such a choice benefits from the well-know advantages of component-based software engineering and from the maturity of the available technologies; on the other, however, the abstraction level provided is inadequate to model some fundamental SOA aspects - such as autonomy, control-uncoupling, data-driven interaction, activities - as firstclass concepts. Such features can be modelled quite naturally by adopting an agent-oriented perspective. In this paper we describe simpA-WS, a Java-based framework for developing SOA/WS applications which adopts an agentoriented programming model based on the general-purpose Agents and Artifacts meta-model (A&A). simpA-WS makes it possible to conceive, design and program services (and applications using services) as workspaces where ensemble of pro-active, activity-oriented entities (agents) work together by exploiting different kinds of passive function-oriented entities (artifacts) used as resources, along with tools to support their business activities. Accordingly, we first present the simpA-WS framework and the related simpA language - an extension of Java aimed at capturing the A&A metaphors as first-class entities; we then show how agents and artifacts can be programmed in simpA and how SOA/WS applications can be programmed in simpA-WS; a simple running example is discussed for concreteness.
	Mascardi V.; Cordì V.; Rosso P.	A comparison of Upper Ontologies	2007	Upper Ontologies are quickly becoming a key technology for integrating heterogeneous knowledge coming from different sources. In fact, they may be exploited as a "lingua franca" by intelligent software agents in all those scenarios where it is impossible (or there is no will) for an agent to disclose its own entire ontology to other agent, despite the need to communicate with it. This paper represents the very preliminary step towards the exploitation of Upper Ontologies as bridges for allowing intelligent software agents to align heterogeneous ontologies in an automatic way, where we analyse the most up-to-date state-of-theart. In this paper we analyse 7 Upper Ontologies, namely BFO, Cyc, DOLCE, GFO, PROTON, Sowa's ontology, and SUMO, according to a set of standard software engineering criteria, and we synthesise our analysis in form of a comparative table. A summary of some existing comparisons drawn among subsets of the 7 Upper Ontologies that we deal with in this document, is also provided.

A framework for interacting situated agents in virtual environments	2007	This paper presents a framework supporting the definition and implementation of virtual environment inhabited by interacting situated agents defined according to the Multilayered Multi-Agent Situated System model. The framework supports the specification and execution of visually rich 3D virtual environment endowed by the presence of mobile agents acting and interacting inside it according to a multi-agent model. The paper briefly describes the related works and possible application scenarios for the framework, then it introduces the multi-agent model underlying the framework and its basic architecture. Sample applications are also described so as to show the potential of the framework in executing models comprising several hundreds of agents producing an effective visualization of the generated dynamics.

News retrieval through a multiagent system	2007	The continuous growth of information sources on the web, together with the corresponding volume of dailyupdated contents, makes the problem of finding news and articles a challenging task. This paper presents a multiagent system aimed at creating press reviews from online newspapers by progressively filtering information that flows from sources to the end user, so that only relevant articles are retained. Once extracted, newspaper articles are classified according to a hierarchical text categorization approach. Moreover, an optional feedback provided by the user is exploited to improve the overall performances. The system is built upon a generic multiagent architecture that supports the implementation of personalized, adaptive and cooperative multiagent systems devised to retrieve, filter and reorganize information in a web-based environment.

Agents and security in a cultural assets transport scenario	2007	Museums and exhibitions represent a relevant contribution to the economy all over the world. In Italy, in the year 2006 the 400 national museums, monuments and archaeological sites have been visited by 34.492.875 people with an average entrance fee of 6,64 euro for person while in France 18.367.000 people decided to dedicate some time for visiting the national museums. Considered the increasing relevance of the cultural and economical level of museums, several works in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have proposed new methodologies for supporting the users during their visits. However, few research groups have faced the problem of the cultural assets transport. This paper pays attention to a particular aspect of the museum activities: how to identify and to transport in a secure way the cultural assets. In fact, a higher security in transport among museums may increase the exchanges and, consequently, the cultural offer. For reaching this goal we exploited the Galileo Satellite services and the Intelligent Agents technology and we experimented the system in a real scenario.

	Poggi A.; Tomaiuolo M.; Turci P.	An agent-based service oriented architecture	2007	Industry is more and more interested in executing business functions that span multiple applications. This demands high-levels of interoperability and a more flexible and adaptive business process management. The trend is to have systems assembled from a loosely coupled collection of Web services, which are ubiquitous and organically integrated. This technical area appears to be a natural environment in which the agent technology can be exploited with significant advantages. In the present paper, we propose a framework with the aim of supporting an agent-based SOA. The peculiar characteristic and strength of our research work is the integration of the agent technology with other strategic technologies, that is Web services, workflow, rule engine and semantic Web.
	Piunti M.; Castelfranchi C.; Falcone R.	Expectations driven approach for situated, goal-directed agents	2007	Situated agents engaged in open systems continually face with external events requiring adequate services and behavioral responses. In these conditions agents should be able to improve their adaptivity over time, namely 1) to deal with and anticipate relevant changes and critical situations, 2) to temporally define relative priorities between goals varying their importance over time and 3) to use informational feedback to learn from experience and become better at achieving their goals. This work provides an insight to model goal directed agents with these adaptive and anticipatory abilities, based on context awareness and growing experience at achieving their activities. We propose an approach by which affective states are placed as an integrated control mechanism in order to tight different processes and computational modules underlying reasoning.

A swarm intelligence method applied to manufacturing scheduling	2007	In this paper we present a multi-agent search technique to face the NP-hard single machine total weighted tardiness scheduling problem in presence of sequence-dependent setup times. The search technique is called Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO): differently from previous approaches the proposed DPSO uses a discrete model both for particle position and velocity and a coherent sequence metric. We tested the proposed DPSO over a benchmark available online. The results obtained show the competitiveness of our DPSO, which is able to outperform the best known results for the benchmark, and the effectiveness of the DPSO swarm intelligence mechanisms.
	Cannata N.; Corradini F.; Piersigilli F.; Merelli E.; Vito L.	Semantic resource management in MAS	2007	In highly dynamic environments like academy and industry it is becoming essential the need of efficient systems for resources organization and discovery. In this paper we describe a semantic resources manager, called Resourceome. This system allows both to discover and organize resources for agents' goals achievement. The ontological descriptions of resources and of domains allow to contextualize a resource instance in its domain through a concern relation. The proposed model supports the navigation from domain to resource concepts and vice versa. Resourceome represents our proposal for describing the particular vision of the world perceived by multi-agent systems.
	Deufemia V.; Polese G.; Tortora G.; Vacca M.	Conceptual foundations of interrogative agents	2007	Reasoning by interrogation is one of the most ancient and experimented ways of reasoning. Originated by the Aristotelian elenchus, it has been used for many purposes, such as the resolution of mathematical and daily problems [25], [26], the discovery of new knowledge [19], [34], [36], the realization of questioning/answering processes [23]. In this paper we present the conceptual foundations of interrogative agents, a new model of BDI architecture based on interrogative logic. This model allows us to express the properties of agents in a natural way, and to use heuristics for reasoning. Finally, in order to explicate the whole approach and to highlight its main features we describe the application of interrogative agents in the context of database refactoring.
1	Baldoni M.; Baroglio C.; Martelli A.; Patti V.; Schifanella C.	Preserving player's goals: A choreography-driven matchmaking approach	2007	An agent interaction protocol, a service choreography, can quite naturally be interpreted as an alliance of parties, which cooperate to achieve a goal. On the other hand, each participant entered the alliance moved by goals of its own, which it would like to fulfill by playing one of the roles. The achievement of the shared and of the specific goals depend both on the interaction schema, that is captured by the choreography, and on the participant's capabilities, where by this word we mean the skills of the participant, the actions that it can execute. We show in this paper that the choice of which capabilities to use cannot rely totally on local criteria, as instead it is commonly done by the approaches to matchmaking, but it must take into account the choreography/protocol. This happens whenever the match is not exact, e.g. when plugin match is used. We also describe an extended plugin match that takes into account also the constraints given by the choreography for performing the capability selection.

A multi-agent platform supporting maintenance companies on the field	2007	In this paper we present the European project named E-Support, aimed to the maintenance companies which work on the field, away from the central headquarters. The main goal of E-Support is to help the field engineers and technicians to access the knowledge base of the company. They will connect to remote servers by using mobile devices in order to get information about vendors, customers, plants, parts and download technical documents. The whole system will be implemented by a multi-agent platform running agents on mobile devices and server agents that provide the services. A particular emphasis will be placed on the contribution of D'Appolonia regarding the document retrieval system.

ELDATool: A Statecharts-based tool for prototyping Multi-Agent Systems	2007	This paper briefly describes the ELDATool, a Statecharts-based visual tool for the rapid prototyping of Multi-Agent Systems based on the Event-driven Lightweight Distilled Statecharts-based Agents (ELDA) model. In particular, the ELDATool, which is implemented in Java as an Eclipse plug-in, supports an iterative process involving the following phases: detailed design, automatic code generation and simulation. The high-level design, which is the input to this iterative process, can be obtained through currently available agent-oriented methodologies such as PASSI and GAIA. In order to show the main characteristics of the ELDATool, a simple case study is presented.
	Vecchiola C.; Grosso A.; Passadore A.; Anghinolfi D.; Boccalatte A.; Paolucci M.	An agent based solution for dispatching items in a distributed environment	2007	This paper describes Herald, an agent based toolkit for dispatching and processing items in a distributed environment. Herald is suitable for scenarios where the process could be modeled as a tree: starting from the root node the collection of items is distributed along the nodes where they can be processed, forwarded to other nodes, and duplicated if necessary. Herald assigns a specific software agent to each node of the tree which participates into the dispatching process according to the knowledge base of the multi-agent system. Herald works as a general infrastructure for simulating, testing and executing dispatching algorithms that can be easily integrated into the system by changing the decision making process of the agents composing the architecture. A prototypal implementation, based on the AgentService programming framework, is then presented as a proof of its applicability in industrial scenarios.

Achieving business process agility in Engineering Change Management with Agent Technology	2007	The importance of business processes for a successful enterprise cannot be overestimated. They are core assets through which a business turns its potential into actual competitiveness on the market. To face the challenges posed by today's changing and uncertain business environment, traditional BPM approaches are not sufficient anymore.

Beyond the problem and solution description, this work presents a concrete case study in the domain of Engineering Change Management.
	Baldoni M.; Baroglio C.; Berio G.; Marengo E.	Declarative representation of curricula models: An LTL- and UML-based approach	2007	In this work, we present a constrained-based representation for specifying the goals of "course design", that we call curricula model, and introduce a graphical language, grounded into Linear Time Logic, to design curricula models which include knowledge of proficiency levels. Based on this representation, we show how model checking techniques can be used to verify that the user's learning goal is supplied by a curriculum, that a curriculum is compliant to a curricula model, and that competence gaps are avoided. This proposal represents the most recent advancement of a work, carried on in the last years, in which we are investigating the use of both agents and web services for building and validating curricula.We also outline future research directions.

Design and development of intentional systems with PRACTIONIST Studio	2008	In this paper we present PRACTIONIST Studio, which is an integrated design and development environment for BDI agent-based systems, providing facilities and tools to represent the concepts and intentional elements underlying such a model as well as several common features offered by UML-based tools. PRACTIONIST Studio aims at bridging the gap between the increasing trend of developing BDI-based multi-agent systems and the availability of tools for their design. It supports developers from early requirements analysis to automatic code generation. More in detail, we first give an overview of the modelling editors provided with PRACTIONIST Studio. Then some fragments of the modelling and development approach when applied to a real-world implementation are presented. Such a complex system is the PSTS (PRACTIONIST Stock Trading System), which is aimed to monitor investors' stock portfolio by managing risk and profit and supporting decisions for on-line stock trading, on the basis of investors' trading rules and their risk attitude.
	Fortino G.; Garro A.; Mascillaro S.; Russo W.	Using multi-coordination for the design of mobile agent interactions	2008	This paper proposes a multi-coordination approach for the design of mobile agent interactions. The approach is founded on the multi-coordination concept, which is a synergic exploitation of multiple coordination models which best fit interaction requirements. In particular, the proposed approach is based on two steps: (i) candidate design solutions are defined through a procedure which allows to identify the most effective coordination models for a given mobile agent interaction scenario; (ii) the defined candidate design solutions are quantitatively evaluated through a discrete-event simulation framework which allows for an easy evaluation of mobile agent interaction scenarios in terms of ad-hoc defined performance indices.
	Briola D.; Locoro A.; Mascardi V.	Ontology agents in FIPA-compliant platforms: A survey and a new proposal	2008	In 2001, FIPA delivered a specification suggesting that each MAS should integrate an "Ontology Agent" (OA) offering services for ontology management. These services should include ontology discovery, maintenance, matching, as well as translation of expressions between different ontologies or content languages. Currently, no FIPA-compliant OA exists that implements all of them. One of the reasons is that providing a service for ontology matching is not an easy task, and coping with translation between ontologies and/or content languages may be even harder. In this paper we survey the state of the art in the area, and we describe our prototypical implementation of an OA for Jade able to match ontologies. Besides "standard" ontology matching algorithms, our OA offers a "matching via upper ontologies" method that, as we showed in a recent technical report, improves the precision of the matching w.r.t. the use of traditional techniques.
	Dalpiaz F.; Ali R.; Asnar Y.; Bryl V.; Giorgini P.	Applying Tropos to Socio-Technical system design and runtime configuration	2008	Recent trends in Software Engineering have introduced the importance of reconsidering the traditional idea of software design as a socio-tecnical problem, where human agents are integral part of the system along with hardware and software components. Design and runtime support for Socio-Technical Systems (STSs) requires appropriate modeling techniques and non-traditional infrastructures. Agent-oriented software methodologies are natural solutions to the development of STSs, both humans and technical components are conceptualized and analyzed as part of the same system. In this paper, we illustrate a number of Tropos features that we believe fundamental to support the development and runtime reconfiguration of STSs. Particularly, we focus on two critical design issues: risk analysis and location variability. We show how they are integrated and used into a planning-based approach to support the designer in evaluating and choosing the best design alternative. Finally, we present a generic framework to develop self-reconfigurable STSs.
	Bandini S.; Bonomi A.; Vizzari G.	Supporting the design of self-organizing ambient intelligent systems through agent-based simulation	2008	The ambient intelligence scenario depicts electronic environments that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of people. The aims of this kind of system is not necessarily to provide some form of electronic service to its users, but also to enhance the everyday experience of people moving inside the related physical environment. For this second type of application, computer simulation represents a useful way to envision the behaviour of responsive environments without actually bringing them into existence in the real world. This paper will describe the simulation of an adaptive illumination facility, a physical environment endowed with a set of sensors that perceive the presence of humans (or other entities such as dogs, bicycles, cars) and interact with a set of actuators (lights) that coordinate their state to adapt the ambient illumination to the presence and behaviours of its users. This system is made up of a model managing the self-organization of the adaptive illumination facility and an agent-based model to simulate pedestrian dynamics in the physical environment in which the system is deployed.

Using agent technology as a support for an Enterprise Service Bus	2008	The research in distributed artificial intelligence has been addressing for several years the problem of designing and building coordinated and collaborative intelligent multiagent systems. This interesting and advanced work can be fruitfully exploited in the area of service-oriented computing if agent technology is appropriately engineered and integrated with the key technologies in this field. To support this claim, in this paper we show how the agent technology integrated in an Enterprise Service Bus allows the conception and realization of real flexible, adaptive intelligent service-oriented systems.
1	Piunti M.; Ricci A.	From Agents to Artifacts back and forth: Operational and doxastic use of artifacts in MAS	2008	Recent approaches in Multi-Agent Systems are focusing on providing models and methodologies for the design of environments and special purpose tools supposed to ease programming in the large and scale up growing complexities. Among others, the Agents and Artifacts (A&A) approach introduced the notion af artifact as first class abstraction providing agents with external facilities, services and coordination medium explicitely conceived for promoting their activities. In this paper we analyse A&A systems by focusing on the functional roles played by artifacts. In particular, we here investigate the function of artifacts once they are employed in the context of societies of cognitve agents, i.e. agents capable to reason about their epistemic and motivational states. In this context, a twofold kind of interaction is envisaged. On the one side, artifact rapresentational function allows agent to improve epistemic states, i.e., by representing and sharing strategic knowledge in the overall system (doxastic use). On the other side, artifacts operational function allows agents to improve the repertoire of actions, i.e., by providing additional means which can be purposively triggered by agents to achieve goals (operational use). Some of the outcomes of this approach are discussed along with test cases showing agents engaged in goal-oriented activities relying on the transmission of relevant knowledge and the operations provided by artifacts.

Conservative re-use ensuring matches for service selection	2008	The greater and greater quantity of services that are available over the web causes a growing attention to techniques that facilitate their reuse. A web service specification can be quite complex, including various operations and message exchange patterns. In this work, we give a declarative representation of services, and in particular of WSDL operations, that enables the application of techniques for reasoning about actions and change. By means of these techniques it becomes possible to reason on the specification of choreography roles and on possible role players, as a basis for selecting services which match in a flexible way with the specifications. Flexible match is, indeed, fundamental in order to enable web service reuse but it does not guarantee the preservation of the goals, that can be proved over the role specification itself. We show how to enrich various kinds of match proposed in the literature so to produce substitutions that preserve goals.
	Villalba C.; Rosi A.; Viroli M.; Zambonelli F.	Nature-inspired spatial metaphors for pervasive service ecosystems	2008	Innovative paradigms and frameworks have to be identified to enable the effective deployment and execution of pervasive computing services. Such frameworks must be conceived so as to match the spatially-situated nature of pervasive services, and must be able to exhibit properties of self-organization and self-adaptability, self-management, and of long-lasting evolvability. This paper discusses how such frameworks should get inspiration from natural systems, by enabling modeling and deployment of services as autonomous individuals, spatially-situated in an ecosystem of other services, data sources, and pervasive devices, all of which acting, interacting, and evolving according to a limited set of spatial "eco-laws". In this context, this paper presents a reference architecture to uniformly frame ecosystem concepts, surveys and critically analyzes different nature-inspired spatial metaphors to realize the idea, and details our current research agenda concerning the development of service frameworks inspired to the ecological metaphor.

AgentService in a hand	2008	In this paper we present AgentService Mobile: an infrastructure aimed to the execution of agents on devices with limited resources. The mobile device plays the role of a client which consumes a set of services exposed by the AgentService platform. This is the entry of AgentService in a SOA context, with the main goal to open the multi-agent platform to the outside, by using the most recent service oriented technologies.

Advancing object-oriented standards toward Agent-Oriented Methodologies: SPEM 2.0 on SODA	2008	Building ad-hoc design processes and methodologies has become a key challenge in Software Engineering, and several efforts are being made for developing appropriate meta-models both for methodologies and development processes. The Software Process Engineering Meta-model (SPEM) - an OMG objectoriented standard - is a natural candidate for representing, comparing and reusing design processes in a uniform way. In this paper we apply SPEM 2.0 to Agent-Oriented Software Engineering methodologies, so as to assess its strengths and limitations. To this end, we take the SODA methodology as a significant case study, and compare the meta-model of its process obtained from SPEM 2.0 with the former meta-model obtained from SPEM 1.0.
	Oliva E.; Viroli M.; Omicini A.	Arguments and artifacts for dispute resolution	2008	In a social context cultural differences, individual interests, and partial awareness are often the causes of disputes. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is usually considered to be alternative to litigation, and can also be used to allow disputing parts to find an agreement. A dispute resolution is not an easy task and usually involves more entities including mediator or arbitrator with multiple dialogue sessions. In the paper we focus the attention on dispute resolution system in artificial society proposing a model and a technology to support the persuasive processes. The persuasion is the principal form dialogue used in an ADR system where agents exchange arguments to support their positions. The general architecture proposed to build an ADR system exploits two artifacts abstractions - Co-Argumentation Artifact and Dialogue Artifact - that provide the right abstractions to coordinate the agents during the argumentative process. The technological support for the artifacts is provided by the TuCSoN infrastructure, also exploiting a meta-programming technique in Prolog. Finally, in the paper we present a simplified example of the execution of a persuasion dialogue ground on the commitments.
	Ciuro A.; Cossentino M.; Fontana G.; Gaglio S.; Rizzo R.; Vitali M.	Towards a new inheritance definition in multi-agent systems	2008	Growing complexity of software systems leads some researchers to explore new paradigms like self-organization and genetic programming. We regard this problem as a new occurrence of a need that has been partially solved in the past with the introduction of object-orientation whose most innovative feature can probably be agreed to be inheritance. In this work, the authors propose a different approach for solving the initially discussed process. The definition of a new "nature-inspired" inheritance is discussed. Agents according to this approach can reproduce by mixing their genome and generate new agents that can better fit a specific problem.
	Dalpiaz F.; Molesini A.; Puviani M.; Seidita V.	Towards filling the gap between AOSE methodologies and infrastructures: Requirements and meta-model	2008	Many different methodologies have been proposed in Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) literature, and the concepts they rely on are different from those adopted when implementing the system. This conceptual gap often creates inconsistencies between specifications and implementation. We propose a metamodel-based approach that aims to bridge this gap, resulting in an integrated meta-model that merges the best aspects of four relevant AOSE methodologies (GAIA, Tropos, SODA and PASSI). The meta-model assembly followed a welldefined process: for each methodology to be integrated in the meta-model, we elicited the requirements, identified a set of process fragments, thoroughly compared the concepts belonging to the various fragments, and finally composed the meta-model.

A prolog-based MAS for railway signalling monitoring: Implementation and experiments	2008	This paper describes the outcomes of a project that involved DISI, the Computer Science Department of Genoa University, and Ansaldo Segnalamento Ferroviario, the Italian leader in design and construction of signalling and automation systems for conventional and high speed railway lines. The result of the project, started in February 2008 and ended in September 2008, is an implemented MAS prototype that monitors processes running in a railway signalling plant, detects functioning anomalies, and provides support to the early notification of problems to the Command and Control System Assistance. The MAS has been implemented using DCaseLP, a multi-language prototyping environment developed at DISI, that provides libraries for integrating TuProlog agents into Jade. Due to the intrinsic rule-based nature of monitoring agents, Prolog has been proved extremely suitable for their implementation.
	Bergenti F.; Poggi A.	Multi-agent systems for e-health and the CASCOM project	2008	e-Health services and applications are probably one of the notable application fields where agent technology might act as a main actor in the near future. Multi-agent systems have been devised to deal with classes of problems-e.g., remote and heterogeneous software integration, remote monitoring and assistance-that are very typical for the large part of e-health services and applications. This paper describes some of the main reasons why multi-agent systems are now considered one of the best solutions for the realization and deployment of advances ehealth software. The paper motivates this claim by addressing very general issues that have been previously identified as key problems of e-health. The paper is structured in two main parts. The first introduces the technological problems that characterize e-health and it shows how multi-agent systems tackle them. The second part describes an important European scale project that has recently adopted multi-agent systems to realize an e-health application scenario, i.e., decentralized emergency assistance.
	Addis A.; Armano G.; Vargiu E.	Profiling users to perform contextual advertising	2009	Recommendation systems are typically aimed at proposing items to users. Nevertheless, another way of performing recommendations is viable, i.e. proposing users to domain specific web sites. Within this context, users require to be represented according to their preferences -given in terms of categories of interest. To better highlight the need for "recommending users", let us recall that commercial web sites are typically involved with one or more domain-specific businesses. In this scenario, a system able to identify relevant categories can be useful to identify users that may become target for advertisement (for instance, a company that sells pet supplies, food and products is interested in identifying users that have the "Animals" category among their interests). The goal of this research is to develop agent-based referral systems for user profiling able to identify user interests. Given a taxonomy and a set of documents representing a user (i.e. selected by the user while surfing the web) the system is able to profile her/him in terms of the given categories. For the sake of simplicity, experiments have been performed using WordNet Domains as reference taxonomy and Wikipedia as document source. The underlying assumption is that, due to the general-purpose machine learning techniques adopted to implement the system, this capability is exportable to other -more specific- taxonomies.
	Passadore A.; Grosso A.; Boccalatte A.	Indexing enterprise knowledge bases with AgentSeeker	2009	The aim of this paper is to introduce AgentSeeker: a multi-agent platform for indexing local and online textual files, with the semantic contribution of domain specific ontologies. These ontologies describe the application domain and the competences the user is referring to, during the interaction with the platform, namely a query session. AgentSeeker is addressed to enterprise applications, thanks to its flexible and scalable structure. Companies with significant electronic knowledge bases can take advantages from AgentSeeker, for their business activities. The value added of AgentSeeker is represented by an Ontology Agent which is devoted to manage semantic representations of the enterprise domain, organizing the results of a user's query, according to the concepts which represent the relevant entities in the company business.

A hybrid agent architecture for situated agents based virtual environments	2009	This paper introduces a hybrid agent-architecture for situated agents representing pedestrians in virtual environments. The presented agent architecture is an extension of a model supporting the definition of environments encompassing situated agents, whose behavioural specification was mainly based on simple reactive rules. The new architecture supports a more compact specification of agent's behaviours by endowing agents with a qualitative form of knowledge about the environment and simple rules to autonomously construct a line.

Dynamic resource allocation in a MAS: A case study from the industry	2009	This paper describes the theoretic issues and the design of an implemented Multiagent System developed by DISI, the Computer Science Department of the University of Genova, and Ansaldo-STS, the Italian leader in design and construction of signalling and automation systems for conventional and high speed railway lines. The problem discussed in this paper is a multiagent resource allocation problem where resources are modeled as nodes in a directed, non-planar graph that agents must traverse from one start point to one end point. The goal of the multiagent system is to find a feasible allocation of resources to agents over time that emerges as the result of a sequence of local negotiation steps. The multiagent system has been implemented using JADE and exploits the JADEWeb Services Integration Gateway to access legacy applications developed by Ansaldo-STS. It has already been tested on real data and will be integrated into one of Ansaldo-STS's core business applications in a few months.

	Bellifemine F.L.; Fortino G.	ASPINE: An agent-oriented design of SPINE	2009	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are emerging as powerful platforms for distributed embedding computing. Currently, flexible frameworks and middlewares are emerging to facilitate WSN application development which is usually very applicationspecific and involves the programming of low-level mechanisms for enabling sensing, communication and energy saving. SPINE is a domain-specific framework for distributed processing of sensed data which is currently being applied to the rapid prototyping of body sensor networks applications for human body activity recognition. In this paper we present ASPINE, an agent-oriented design of the SPINE framework. According to the agentparadigm, each base station-side and sensor node-side component of SPINE (coordinator, sensor manager, function manager, communication manager) is designed as a software interacting agent with specific capabilities. The set of agents of a node constitute a local multi-agent system (MAS) which carries out a local goal (e.g. sensing and feature extraction on sensed data) whereas a set of cooperating nodes represents a distributed MAS pursuing a global goal (e.g. classification of human body postures). Finally, we also describe the design of an implementation of ASPINE based on MAPS, an agent platform for Java SunSPOTs.
	Poggi A.; Turci P.	An agent-based bridge between business process and business rules	2009	Industry has been and still is, more than ever, interested in executing business functions that span multiple applications. This demands high-levels of interoperability and a more flexible and adaptive business process management. In the attempt to delineate an effective solution, some researchers have envisaged as strategic the integration of the service-oriented technology with business process management, semantic and Web technologies. Others have turned their attention towards agent technology, integrated with the aforementioned technologies, as an interesting means for implementing business systems. In these years, our research work has been mainly devoted to improving the integration of the JADE agents with the most interesting knowledge and internet-oriented technologies. In this paper we present our latest effort consisting of the integration of workflow and rule technologies in multi-agent systems. The approach is based on the use of rule engines as part of service implementation and the use of business process engines for service orchestration. Agents play a mediation role and their coordination properties are essential for the realization of an increasingly flexible and effective business process management.

Planning socially intelligent reactions in a caring robot	2009	Ambient Intelligence solutions may provide a great opportunity for elderly people to live longer at home. Assistance and care are delegated to the intelligence embedded in the environment. However, besides considering service-oriented response to the user needs, the assistance has to take into account the establishment of social relations that become particularly relevant when media are not boxed in a desktop computer but are integrated pervasively in everyday life environments. We propose the use of a robot NICA (as the name of the project Natural Interaction with a Caring Agent) acting as a caring assistant that provides a social interface with the smart home services. In this paper, we introduce the general architecture of the robot's "mind" and then we focus on the need to properly react to affective and socially oriented situations. In doing so, the robot implements a meta-level reasoner able to interpret the situation and to understand when to interrupt the current behavior in order to handle the new situation. To this aim it uses a probabilistic model to revise its beliefs and to trigger high-level goals. According to the selected goal the behavioral plan is computed by choosing the most appropriate set of actions.
	Addis A.; Armano G.; Vargiu E.	Monitoring boats in marine reserves: A MAS solution	2009	The application of agent methodologies in process monitoring and control is a relatively novel approach, particularly suitable for distributed and dislocated systems. As for marine reservers, access monitoring is aimed at avoiding intrusions of unauthorized boats - also considering that, typically, marine reserves are located in areas not easily accessible. Typical solutions consist of using radar systems or suitable cameras activated by movement sensors. In this paper, we present a multiagent system aimed at monitoring boats in marine reserves. The goal of the proposed system is to discriminate between authorized and unauthorized boats - the formers being equipped with GPS+GSM devices. Boats are tracked by a digital radar that detects their positions. The system has been used to monitor boats in a marine reserve located in the North of Sardinia. Results show that adopting the proposed approach facilitates the system administrator, as well as staff operators, in the task of identifying intrusions.
	Santoro C.	Towards an agent programming language	2009	This paper is an analysis of the characteristics of software agents and multi-agent systems aiming at deriving the basic concepts and capabilities that a "good" agent programming language should have. The paper deals with this topic from two different point of views: it analyzes agent's properties in order to understand which language constructs and abstractions could be worth, and then refines this analysis by exploiting agent meta-models provided by agent-oriented software engineering methodologies. Even if the objective is quite ambitious, the concepts derived can be considered a starting point for a work leading to the specification and implementation of a mainstream agent programming language.

Then, a motivated introduction of a novel protocol for automated trust negotiation in multi-agent systems is presented and the basic features of the protocol are discussed.

Multiagent systems can be considered a suitable technology for the development of healthcare applications where the use of loosely coupled and heterogeneous components, the dynamic and distributed management of data and the remote collaboration among users are often considered the most relevant requirements. This paper provides a structured enumeration of the most notable recent attempts to use multi-agent systems for healthcare.
	Garro A.; Russo W.	Exploiting the easyABMS methodology in social and economic domains	2009	Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) represents a powerful approach for analyzing and modeling modern social and economic systems as they can be naturally conceived as composed of autonomous, goal-driven and interacting entities (agents) organized into societies. However, although several tools for ABMS are available, there are few methodologies and related processes which are able to cover all the phases from the analysis of the system under consideration to its modeling and simulation results analysis. Moreover, the absence of visual modeling tools and techniques for ABMS often constitutes an entry barrier for whoever lacks advanced programming skills. This paper presents and exemplifies through a case study an integrated and iterative methodology (easyABMS) specifically conceived for agent-based modeling and simulation of complex systems which is able to support domain experts in fully exploiting the benefits of the ABMS while significantly reducing programming and implementation efforts. The case study, concerning the management of a three-stage supply chain, shows how easyABMS can be effectively exploited for the agent-based modeling and simulation of modern social and economic systems.

Towards a MAS model for crowd simulation at pop-rock concerts exploiting ontologies and fuzzy logic	2009	This paper illustrates a formal method to support crowd profiling phase into the development of Multi Agent Systems model. After a discussion about crowd reasearch context, a methodological tool for crowd classification based on a sociological theory is proposed. The tool uses an ontology based on fuzzy logic and allows the analysis of different crowded scenarios according to crowd features (e.g. density, duration, and so on). In particular it is illustrated the use of this method in relation to concert scenarios. Finally, an interpretation of this scenario, according to agent theory, is given.
	Baldoni M.; Boella G.; Grenna R.	Modeling organizations and roles using a middleware Jade-based	2009	Organizations and roles are often seen as mental constructs, good to be used during the design phase in Multi Agent Systems, but they have also been considered as first class citizens in MAS, when objective coordination is needed. Roles facilitate the coordination of agents inside an organization, and they give new abilities in the context of organizations, called powers, to the agents which satisfy the requirements necessary to play them. No general purpose programming languages for multiagent systems offer primitives to program organizations and roles as instances existing at runtime, so, in this paper, we propose our extension of the Jade framework, with primitives to program in Java organizations structured in roles, and to enable agents to play roles in organizations.We provide classes and protocols which enable an agent to enact a new role in an organization, to interact with the role by invoking the execution of powers, and to receive new goals to be fulfilled. Since roles and organizations can be on a different platform with respect to the role players, the communication with them happens via protocols. Since they can have complex behaviours, they are implemented by extending the Jade agent class. Our aim is to give to programmers a middle tier, built on the Jade platform, useful to solve with minimal implementative effort many coordination problems, and to offer a first, implicit, management of norms and sanctions.
	Castelli G.; Zambonelli F.	A self-organized multiagent approach for distributed management of contextual data	2009	Pervasive computing devices are able to generate enormous amounts of data, from which knowledge about situations and facts occurring in the world should be inferred for the use of pervasive services. However accessing and managing effectively such a huge amount of distributed information is challenging for services. In this paper we propose a self-organized approach to autonomously organize distributed contextual data items into sorts of knowledge networks. Knowledge networks are conceived as an alive self-organized layer in charge of managing data, that can facilitate services in extracting useful information out of a large amount of distributed items. We motivate our approach and present the W4 Data Model that we used to represent contextual data. On these basis, we introduce the general idea of W4 Knowledge Networks and we detail the specific bio-inspired approach for self-organized networking of data items. A case study is introduced to clarify the concepts expressed, and experimental results are reported to support our arguments and proposal.

Roles in building web applications using Java	2009	In this paper we apply the powerJava model of roles and relationships to a web application programming environment. First we show how the notion of role, as defined in powerJava, combines and automates several aspects which are important in web application programming, and which are now unrelated and dealt with separately and mostly by hand, and thus prone to errors. Second we show how from the powerJava code a web application can be automatically constructed using Struts and Spring.
	Puviani M.; Cabri G.; Leonardi L.	The future of AOSE: Exploiting SME for a new conception of methodologies	2009	In the last years, the software engineering field has provided developers with different methodologies to support their work. Nevertheless, existing methodologies can hardly meet the requirements of all existing scenarios, which are more and more complex and highly differentiated. This problem can be faced by applying the Situational Method Engineering (SME) approach, which enables to build appropriate methodologies by composing "fragments" of existing ones. We envision this approach as the future of software engineering in general, and in particular if applied in Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE). This approach has also the valuable advantage of reusing models, solutions, experiences and tools of existing and tested methodologies. In this paper we report three examples of application of the Situational Method Engineering approach in AOSE. We show that this approach can be applied following different directions, and in particular: entity-driven, metamodel-driven, and characteristic-driven. To concretely show these directions, we present three examples of methodologies for developing agent systems (one regarding self-organising systems), all constructed composing methodology fragments to meet the scenario requirements.
	Piunti M.; Ricci A.; Santi A.	SOA/WS applications using cognitive agents working in CArtAgO environments	2009	In this paper we propose a programming model and the supporting technologies for designing and programming Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) in the perspective of Multi-Agent Systems and agent-oriented paradigms. In particular, the approach is meant to be useful for the design and programming of complex service-oriented systems, by providing first-class design tools to implement challenging features of nextcoming service applications. Indeed, besides autonomy, loose-coupled interactions, openness, flexibility, etc., the proposed design model promotes: (i) the use of a strong notion of agency, thus agents that can be defined along their mental attitudes to be fully autonomous systems, with pro-active and goal oriented abilities with respect of the achievement of their tasks; (ii) the definition artifact-based work environments where agents are meant to work and interact, thus enabling intelligent and cognitive agents to co-use, expose and manage web service technologies in a suitable functional fashion by the mean of special artifactbased infrastructures. Besides describing the basic concepts underlying the agent and artifact programming model for web services, a developing platform called CArtAgO-WS is introduced along with a describing example explored to show the approach in practice.

Towards a flexible development framework for multi-agent systems	2010	In this paper, we present a software framework, called HDS (Heterogeneous Distributed System), that tries to simplify the realization of distributed applications and, in particular, of multi-agent systems, by: i) abstracting the use of different technologies for the realization of distributed applications on networks of heterogeneous devices connected through a set of different communication transport protocols, ii) merging the client-server and the peer-to-peer paradigms, and iii) implementing all the interactions among the processes of a system through the exchange of typed messages that allow the implementation of a large set of communication protocols and languages.
1	Zambonelli F.; Viroli M.	From service-oriented architectures to nature-inspired pervasive service ecosystems	2010	Emerging pervasive computing scenarios require open service frameworks promoting situated adaptive behaviors and supporting diversity in services and long-term evolvability. We argue that this naturally calls for a nature-inspired approach, in which pervasive services are modeled and deployed as autonomous individuals in an ecosystem of other services, data sources, and pervasive devices. As an evolution of standard service-oriented architectures, we present a general framework framing the concepts expressed, and discuss a number of natural metaphors that we can adopt to concretely incarnate the proposed framework and implement pervasive service ecosystems.

An ad hoc agent based architecture is defined in order to implement the robot control system in both simulation and real applications. The coordination of the multi-robot system is based on agent interaction and negotiation, and a communication infrastructure based on open web standards is provided. The system employs the RFID technology for building a context aware information system which is the base of the coordination strategies.
1	Fortino G.; Galzarano S.	Programming Wireless Body Sensor Network applications through agents	2010	Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are currently emerging as one of the most disruptive technologies enabling and supporting next generation ubiquitous and pervasive computing scenarios. In particular, Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs) are conveying notable attention as their real-world applications aim at improving the quality of human beings life by enabling continuous and real-time non-invasive assistance at low cost. This paper proposes a high-level programming approach based on the agent-oriented model to flexibly design and efficiently implement WBSNs applications. The approach is exemplified through a case study concerning a real-time human activity monitoring system which is developed through two different agent-based frameworks: MAPS (Mobile Agent Platform for Sun SPOT) and AFME (Agent Factory Micro Edition). The programming effectiveness of MAPS and AFME with respect to the developed systems is finally discussed.
1	Nardini E.; Viroli M.; Casadei M.; Omicini A.	A self-organising infrastructure for chemical-semantic coordination: Experiments in TuCSoN	2010	Recent works proposed the adoption of a natureinspired approach of chemistry for implementing service architectures suitable for pervasive applications [34]. In particular, [31] proposes a chemical-semantic tuple-space model where coordination of data, devices and software agents - representing the services of the pervasive computing application - are reified into proper tuples managed by the coordination infrastructure. Service coordination is enacted by chemical-like reactions that semantically match those tuples accordingly enacting the desired interaction patterns (composition, aggregation, competition, contextualisation, diffusion and decay). After showing and motivating the proposed coordination approach for situated, adaptive, and diversity-accomodating pervasive computing systems, in this paper we outline how it is possible to concretise the approach on the TuCSoN coordination infrastructure, which can been suitably enhanced with modules supporting fuzzy semantic-coordination and execution engine for chemical-inspired coordination laws.
	Manenti L.; Manzoni S.; Vizzari G.; Ohtsuka K.; Shimura K.	Towards an agent-based proxemic model for pedestrian and group dynamic	2010	Models for the simulation of pedestrian dynamics and crowds of pedestrians have already been successfully applied to several scenarios and case studies, off-the-shelf simulators can be found on the market and they are commonly employed by end-user and consultancy companies. However, these models are the result of a first generation of research efforts considering individuals, their interactions with the environment and among themselves, but generally neglecting aspects like (a) the impact of cultural heterogeneity among individuals and (b) the effects of the presence of groups and particular relationships among pedestrians. This work is aimed, on one hand, at clarifying some fundamental anthropological considerations on which most pedestrian models are based, and in particular Edward T. Hall's work on proxemics. On the other hand, the paper will briefly describe the first steps towards the definition of an agentbased model encapsulating in the pedestrian's behavioural model effects capturing both proxemics and influences due to potential presence of groups in the crowd.
	Falcone R.; Castelfranchi C.	Transitivity in trust: A discussed property	2010	Transitivity in trust is very often considered as a quite simple property, trivially inferable from the classical transitivity defined in mathematics, logic, or grammar. In fact the complexity of the trust notion suggests evaluating the relationships with the transitivity in a more adequate way. In this paper, starting from a socio-cognitive model of trust, we analyze the different aspects and conceptual frameworks involved in this relation and show how different interpretations of these concepts produce different solutions and definitions of trust transitivity.

	Franchi E.	A multi-agent implementation of social networks	2010	In this paper, we present a multi-agent system implementing a fully distributed Social Network System supporting user profiles as FOAF profiles. This system is built around the idea that users should be the sole owners of the information they provide (either consciously or unconsciously) and addresses privacy issues by design, also minimizing the amount of information users have to disclose in order to make new friends. Users are represented by agents that both mediate access to private data and proactively negotiate with other agents in order to extend their user's social network. We also present the distributed connection discovery algorithm used by the agents and detail the representation of data in the users' profiles used to support the algorithm. The design is rather agnostic about the layer responsible for the communication technology; here we present a possible implementation on the top of the HDS software framework.

Then, we describe in details the use of multi-agent systems in three software packages for (i) personalized press reviews, (ii) monitoring boats in marine reserves, and (iii) advanced contact centers. Finally, we draw some conclusions and summarize the lesson learnt from described experiences. The discussion focuses on the benefits and problems that the choice of agent technology brought.
1	Piunti M.; Ricci A.; Boissier O.; Hübner J.F.	Programming open systems with agents, environments and organizations	2010	MAS research pushes the notion of openness related to systems combining heterogeneous computational entities. Typically, those entities answer to different purposes and functions and their integration is a crucial issue. Starting from a comprehensive approach in developing agents, organizations and environments, this paper devises an integrated approach and describes a unifying programming model. It introduces the notion of embodied organization, which is described first focusing on the main entities as separate concerns; and, second, establishing different interaction styles aimed to seamlessly integrate the various entities in a coherent system. An integration framework, built on top of Jason, CArtAgO andMoise (as programming platforms for agents, environments and organizations resp.) is described as a suitable technology to build embodied organizations in practice.
	Montagna S.; Omicini A.; Ricci A.	A multiscale agent-based model of morphogenesis in biological systems	2010	Studying the complex phenomenon of pattern formation created by the gene expression is a big challenge in the field of developmental biology. This spatial self-organisation autonomously emerges from the morphogenetic processes and the hierarchical organisation of biological systems seems to play a crucial role. Being able to reproduce the systems dynamics at different levels of such a hierarchy might be very useful. In this paper we propose the adoption of the agent-based model as an approach capable of capture multi-level dynamics. Each cell is modelled as an agent that absorbs and releases substances, divides, moves and autonomously regulates its gene expression. As a case study we present an agent-based model of Drosophila melanogaster morphogenesis. We then propose a formalisation of the model which clearly describe its main components. We finally show simulation results demonstrating the capability of the model of reproducing the expression pattern of the embryo.

A Multi-Agent System for the automated handling of experimental protocols in biological laboratories	2010	Software-based Laboratory Information Management Systems can handle samples, plates, instruments, users, potentially up to the automation of whole workflows. One frustrating element of this predicament is that Life Sciences laboratory protocols are normally expressed in natural languages and thus are scarcely amenable to real automation. We want to defeat this major limitation by way of a project combining Model-Driven Engineering, Workflows, Ontologies and Multiagent systems (MAS). This paper describes the latter ingredient. Our MAS has been implemented with JADE and WADE to automatically interpret and execute a structured representation of laboratory protocols expressed in XPDL+OWL. Our work has recently been tested on a real test case and will shortly be deployed in the field.

MERCURIO: An interaction-oriented framework for designing, verifying and programming multi-agent systems (position paper)	2010	This is a position paper reporting the motivations, the starting point and the guidelines that characterise the MERCURIO 1 project proposal, submitted to MIUR PRIN 2009 2. The aim is to develop formal models of interactions and of the related support infrastructures, that overcome the limits of the current approaches by explicitly representing not only the agents but also the computational environment in terms of rules, conventions, resources, tools, and services that are functional to the coordination and cooperation of the agents. The models will enable the verification of interaction properties of MAS from the global point of view of the system as well as from the point of view of the single agents, due to the introduction of a novel social semantic of interaction based on commitments and on an explicit account of the regulative rules.
	Fichera L.; Marletta D.; Nicosia V.; Santoro C.	A methodology to extend imperative languages with AgentSpeak declarative constructs	2010	This paper presents a novel technique for the support of declarative constructs of AgentSpeak in a imperative language. Starting from an analysis of the characteristics and semantics of AgentSpeak, as well as the requirements of an AgentSpeak implementation, the paper proposes a framework which, by exploiting object-orientation and operator overloading, is able to enrich an imperative language with declarative constructs suitable to represent and write AgentSpeak programs. A concrete implementation of the proposed framework is then given by presenting PROFETA (Python RObotic Framework for dEsigning sTrAtegies), a tool written in Python which adds to this language the capability to write and execute AgentSpeak plans. A case-study shows how PROFETA can be used to easily write strategies for an autonomous mobile robot, designed by the authors for the "Eurobot 2010" international robotic competition.

Documenting SODA: An evaluation of the process documentation template	2010	This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the methodology documentation template proposed by the IEEE FIPA Design Process Documentation and Fragmentation working group [1]. Generally aimed at agent-oriented methodologies, the template is here put to the test by documenting the SODA methodology, so as to obtain a partial but significant evaluation of the template's strengths and weaknesses.
	Ferrari L.; Mamei M.	Classification of whereabouts patterns from large-scale mobility data	2010	Classification of users' whereabouts patterns is important for many emerging ubiquitous computing applications. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a powerful mechanism to extract recurrent behaviors and high-level patterns (called topics) from mobility data in an unsupervised manner. One drawback of LDA is that it is difficult to give meaningful and usable labels to the extracted topics. We present a methodology to automatically classify the topics with meaningful labels so as to support their use in applications. This mechanism is tested and evaluated using the Reality Mining dataset consisting of about 350000 hours of continuous data on human behavior.
	Tranquillin M.; Ferrari C.; Moro M.	Using mobile agents for secure biometric authentication	2010	This paper deals with the definition of a strong authentication model, coupling usual password/PIN based methods with a biometric matching, over a Multi Agent distributed infrastructure. When the user authentication procedure involves personal devices, the Multi Agent System model helps in the distribution of data and algorithms thanks to a better partitioning of roles and responsibilities, enhancing robustness to eavesdropping and tampering by properly moving agents around the system itself. The system architecture is based on specialized agents tied to the different devices, which safely communicate using both symmetric encryption for messages and asymmetric encryption to check principals' roles. Moreover, agents can carry on biometric parameters matching algorithms, bringing computation on those nodes with enough computing power. A complete authentication protocol has been developed and two different demos have been devised and tested. They differ for the tasks assigned to the mobile devices in use. Experiments show that agent capabilities, together with their power of migration, help in maintaining a higher level of security when mobile devices are involved.
1	Messina F.; Pappalardo G.; Santoro C.	A self-organising system for resource finding in large-scale computational grids	2010	This paper presents a novel approach for resource finding and job allocation in a computational Grid. The proposed system is called HYGRA, for HYperspace-based Grid Resource Allocation. The basic principle involves the construction of a virtual hyperspace in which the available amount of each resource type is used as a geometric coordinate, making each Grid node representable as a point in this virtual hyperspace. A distributed overlay construction algorithm aims at connecting each node with the nearest k nodes w.r.t. the euclidean distance defined in the hyperspace. In this system, a job request, which can be also represented as a point, navigates the hyperspace, from node to node, following the overlay links which minimize the euclidean distance between the current node and the target point representing the job itself. The paper describes the algorithms for overlay construction and resource finding and assesses their validity and performances by means of a simulation approach.
	Aronica S.; Benvegna F.; Cossentino M.; Gaglio S.; Langiu A.; Lodato C.; Lopes S.; Maniscalco U.; Sangiorgi P.	An agent-based system for maritime search and rescue operations	2010	Maritime search and rescue operations are critical missions involving personnel, boats, helicopter, aircrafts in a struggle against time often worsened by adversary sea and weather conditions. In such a context, telecommunication and information systems may play a crucial role sometimes concurring to successfully accomplish the mission. In this paper we present an application able to localize the vessel who has launched a rescue request and to plan the most effective path for rescue assets. The application has been realised as a distributed and open multi-agent system deployed on rescue vehicles as well as on a land maritime stations of the Italian Coast Guard. The system is going to be tested in real scenarios by the Coast Guard.
	Tomaiuolo M.; Turci P.	Peer-to-peer delegation for accessing Web services	2010	Hierarchical collaborations between cooperative, rational agents are quite naturally achieved through goal delegation. In the context of a service-oriented architecture, agents responsible for workflow management can subdivide their goals in sub-goals, generate a utility function from each sub-goal and set up a negotiation process with the agents associated to one or more Web services and responsible for the interaction with them. However, such delegations cannot come into effect unless they are associated with a corresponding delegation of privileges, which are needed to access some resources and achieve desired goals. In this paper we present a security mechanism for SOAP-style and REST-style Web services that allows the distribution of the delegation of access rights among different services and clients.
	Manenti L.; Manzoni L.; Manzoni S.	Towards an application of graph structure analysis to a MAS-based model of Proxemic distances in Pedestrian Systems	2010	This paper proposes the use of methods for network analysis in order to study the properties of a dynamic graph that model the interaction among agents in an agent-based model. This model is based on Multi Agent System definition and simulates a multicultural crowd in which proxemics theory and distance perception are taking into account. After a discussion about complex network analysis and crowd research context, an agent-based model based on SCA*PED (Situated Cellular Agents for PEdestrian Dynamics) approach is presented, based on two separated yet interconnected layers representing different aspects of the overall system dynamics. Then, an analysis of network derived from agent interactions in the Proxemic layer is proposed, identifying characteristic structures and their meaning in the crowd analysis. At the end an analysis related to the identification of those characteristic structures in some real examples is proposed.
	Minotti M.; Santi A.; Ricci A.	Developing Web Client applications with JaCa-Web	2010	We believe that agent-oriented programming languages and multi-agent programming technologies provide an effective level of abstraction for tackling the design and programming of mainstream software applications, in particular those that involve the management of asynchronous events and concurrency. In this paper we support this claim in practice by discussing the use of a platform integrating two main agent programming technologies - Jason agent programming language and CArtAgO environment programming framework - to the development of Web Client applications. Following the cloud computing perspective, these kinds of applications will more and more replace desktop applications, exploiting the Web infrastructure as a common distributed operating system, raising however challenges that are not effectively tackled - we argue - by mainstream programming paradigms, such as the objectoriented one.
	Addis A.; Armano G.	DomoBuilder: A multiagent architecture for home automation	2010	Current technologies permit people to make use of various systems able to fulfill most of their needs while being at home. However, their use is often not intuitive and they are also difficult to integrate. In this paper we propose a solution to these issues, together with a pragmatical demonstration of its effectiveness. The architectural solution we devised, called DomoBuilder, is aimed at abstracting hardware (i.e., electronic devices) and software (i.e., applications, systems), with specific emphasis on the ability of simplifying human interaction while combining heterogeneous devices within the same application. In so doing, system integration is promoted, making it easier to devise complex devices that implement new behaviors while preserving ease of use. A case study has also been devised and implemented, which highlights the great potential of the DomoBuilder architecture.
	Baldoni M.; Baroglio C.; Marengo E.; Patti V.; Capuzzimati F.	Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly	2011	Commitment-based protocols are receiving increasing attention as tools for the representation of business interaction in open MAS. As recent proposals, like 2CL, show when the reality to be modeled is characterized by a high degree of regulation, traditional commitment-based protocols, which account only for the constitutive specification of actions, are to be enriched with a regulative specification. This is the case of the measures foreseen by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, aimed at fostering the creation of an integrated financial market within the European Union. This work shows the usefulness of adopting a declarative commitment-based approach by applying it to the MiFID case study. We developed an extension of Winikoff et al.'s enhanced commitment machine, that accounts of 2CL temporal regulations. It allows the analysis of business protocols and, in particular, of the possible violations.

BaSi: Multi-agent based simulation for medieval battles	2011	When dealing with non-trivial social systems, Multi- Agent Based Simulation (MABS) makes it possible to model and simulate social aspects without neglecting articulated motivations, decisions and behaviours by individuals. In this paper, we experiment with the simulation of a peculiar sort of social system - namely, Medieval Battles - by using general-purpose agent methodologies and technologies - namely, SODA and TuCSoN - in order to better understand and emphasise the benefits of MABS in the simulation of social systems.
	Amato A.; Di Martino B.; Venticinque S.	BDI intelligent agents for augmented exploitation of pervasive environments	2011	Agents based application should be able to use pervasive sensors as their own perceptors in order to let the users benefit of context awareness in services exploitation and in order to make mobile services really useful and profitable. The agents described in our approach adapt themselves in response to a changing environment and are able to respond differently, creating entirely new plans, and thus changing their own behavior depending on their past experience. We present a framework that implements the model to supports experts in the domain of the Cultural Heritage to augment the archaeological site with a set of multimedia contents which are delivered by intelligent services to the visitors in order to guide their tour and to enhance their perception of the reality.

For this purpose a UML profile was defined for representing the elements of Moise+ organizational model such as role, mission and group. The proposed notation will be fully illustrated and applied to the classical example provided by the J-Moise+ team.
	Domnori E.; Cabri G.; Leonardi L.	A multi-agent approach for territorial emergency management	2011	The management of territorial emergencies and disasters has become a real issue in the healthcare system. The recent events such as earthquakes and inundations have brought into attention the need for an improvement of rescue operations in order to limit the lost of human lives. Such scenarios require a distributed, context-aware, reactive and autonomous support. In this paper we present an architectural approach for coordination based on the multi-agent technology. In the following, we will show how agents behaviour well fits to these requirements and how they can be efficiently applied to these problems.

Developing applications with HDS	2011	HDS (Heterogeneous Distributed System) is a software framework that tries to simplify the realization of distributed applications and, in particular, of multi-agent systems, by merging the client-server and the peer-to-peer paradigms and by implementing all the interactions among the processes of a system through the exchange of a kind of message that allows the implementation of a large set of communication protocols and languages. HDS has been experimented in the realization of systems for information retrieval and for the analysis of social networks.
	Locoro A.; Mascardi V.; Mortara F.; Sanna R.	Managing unavailabilities in a dynamic scenario following an agent-based approach	2011	The correct management of resources that can become unavailable over time and the efficient (in terms of both cost and time) re-allocation of the services they provided before becoming unavailable, is an open problem that arises in a wide range of application domains. Despite to some differences, many scenarios spanning very different domains, from logistics to industrial automation, from telecommunication to water systems, may be considered as instances of a more general situation, and the actions to take in order to solve the unavailability problem follow similar patterns. In this paper we discuss the implementation of a multiagent system for solving unavailability problems in an artificial - although realistic - scenario which takes inspiration from to the electricity power network domain.
	Manenti L.; Manzoni S.; Vizzari G.	MAKKSim: Dealing with pedestrian groups in MAS-based crowd simulation	2011	The paper presents MAKKSim, an agent-based tool for pedestrian dynamics simulation. The software is a second generation tool in which the presence of pedestrian groups and some cultural elements are explicitly modelled and can be set by the end-user. In this work, an overview on the MAKKSim model and software architecture is presented, by means of the definition of agent behaviours and the analysis of UML diagrams and enduser interface.
1	Cavone D.; De Carolis B.; Ferilli S.; Novielli N.	An agent-based approach for adapting the behavior of a Smart Home Environment	2011	In this paper we propose an agent-based approach for controlling the behavior of a Smart Home Environment that, based on the recognized situation and user goal, selects a suitable workflow for combining services of the environment. To this aim we have developed a butler agent that employs user and context modeling for supporting proactive adaptation of the interaction with the house. The user can interact with the proposed services by accepting, declining or changing them. Such a feedback is exploited by the learning component of the butler to refine the user model and improve its future behavior accordingly. In order to provide a description of how the system might work, a practical example is shown.
	Pianini D.; Viroli M.; Montagna S.	A simulation framework for pervasive services ecosystems	2011	This paper grounds on the SAPERE project (Self- Aware PERvasive Service Ecosystems), which aims at proposing a multi-agent framework for pervasive computing, based on the idea of making each agent (service, device, human) manifest its existence in the ecosystem by a Live Semantic Annotation (LSA), and of coordinating agent activities by a small and fixed set of so-called eco-laws-sort of chemical-like reactions over patterns of LSAs. System dynamics in SAPERE is complex because of opennes and due to the self-requirements imposed by the pervasive computing setting: a simulation framework is hence needed for what-if analysis prior to deployment. In this paper we present a prototype simulator we are developing, tested on a crowd steering scenario. Due to the role of chemicallike dynamics, this is based on a variation of an existing SSA (Stochastic Simulation Algorithm), suitable tailored to the specific features of SAPERE, including dynamicity of network topology, pattern-based application of eco-laws, and temporal triggers.

PROCE: An agent-based PROcess Composition and execution Environment	2011	The paper presents PROCE (PROcess Composition and execution Environment), an agent-based CAME and CASE tool which supports the composition of software development processes, based on the Method Engineering paradigm, and their execution. In particular, the current release of PROCE provides an integrated and flexible environment for the design of SOA applications.
	Bandini S.; Rubagotti F.; Vizzari G.; Shimura K.	A cellular automata model for pedestrian and group dynamics	2011	The simulation of pedestrian dynamics is a consolidated area of application for cellular automata based models: successful case studies can be found in the literature and off-the-shelf simulators are commonly employed by end-users, decision makers and consultancy companies. These models, however, generally consider individuals, their interactions with the environment and among themselves, but they generally neglect (or treat in a simplistic way) aspects like (i) the impact of cultural heterogeneity among individuals and (ii) the effects of the presence of groups and particular relationships among pedestrians. This work describes an innovative cellular automata based model encapsulating in the pedestrian's behavioural model effects representing both proxemics and a simplified account of influences related to the presence of groups in the crowd. The model is tested in a simple scenario to evaluate the implications of some modeling choices and the presence of groups in the simulated scenario. Results are discussed and compared to experimental observations and to data available in the literature.
	Cavone D.; Bergenti F.; Gotta D.	Semantic web services and agents: A reality check	2011	This paper aims at analyzing the state of the art of Web services to understand how they can now play a crucial role in the landscape of agent systems, after several years of uncertainty. The study is first outlined by illustrating the main interfaces and protocols that are now emerging and by providing a list of the main repositories of Web services that are really available in the network. The results of the study clearly show that Representational State Transfer (RESTful) services are overtaking Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) services. Moreover, the results emphasize the lack of really effective repositories. The study also highlights the almost total absence of semantics in surveyed repositories, thus severely limiting the accurate rating of Web services. The overall judgment on the situation of Web service repositories is that it is surprisingly still immature, especially in the Italian and European landscapes. This is the reason why we decided to propose a novel Web portal meant to become an active and maintained collector of semantic Web services accessible to users (especially in Italy) and able to create a solid base for developing agent-based service systems.
	Fortino G.; Galzarano S.; Gravina R.; Guerrieri A.	Agent-based development of wireless sensor network applications	2011	Due to the growing exploitation of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for enhancing all major conventional application domains and enabling brand new application domains, the development of applications based on WSNs has recently gained a significant focus. Thus, design methods, middleware and frameworks have been defined and made available to support high-level programming of WSN applications. However, even though many proposals do exist, more research efforts should still be devoted to the definition of WSN-oriented methodologies and tools fully supporting the development lifecycle of WSN applications. In this paper, we promote the use of the agent paradigm for the development of WSN applications. After providing motivations about synergies between agents and WSNs and a brief overview about agent technology for WSNs, we describe the use of MAPS (Mobile Agent Platform for Sun SPOTs), our agent platform for WSNs, for the development of applications in important application domains based on wireless body sensor networks (e.g. e-Health) and building sensor and actuator networks (e.g. energy efficient buildings). Finally, we delineate the characteristics on which fullfledged agent-oriented methodologies for WSN applications could be built.
1	Forestiero A.; Mastroianni C.	Description of the Self-Chord P2P application	2011	This paper presents the implementation of the "Self-Chord" P2P system. Self-Chord inherits the ability of Chord-like structured systems for the construction and maintenance of an overlay of peers, but features enhanced functionalities deriving from ant-inspired algorithms, such as autonomy behavior, self-organization and capacity to adapt to a changing environment. Self-Chord has three main advantages with respect to classical structured P2P systems, especially in the context of Grid and Cloud Computing: (i) it is possible execute range queries efficiently; (ii) the load balance among peers is improved; (iii) maintenance load is reduced because resources are spontaneously redistributed when peers disconnect or reconnect to the systems, or when resources are added/modified. In this paper, we summarize the main functionalities of the Self-Chord application, and illustrate the configuration and parameter settings, with the help of an example.
	Serra R.	On the dynamics of gene regulatory networks	2011	It is shown that a simplified model of genetic regulatory networks, aimed at the study of their generic properties, can shed light on some important biological phenomena. Two cases are analyzed, namely perturbations in gene expression induced in an organism by the knock-out of selected genes, and cell differentiation. The role of simplified models in biology is discussed.
	Briola D.; Mascardi V.	Multi agent resource allocation: A comparison of five negotiation protocols	2011	This paper describes five systems that exploit negotiation strategies to solve multiagent resource allocation problems. A deep comparison is drawn among them according to different criteria that involve general features of the systems; adherence to widely accepted agent definitions; domain, purpose, and approach; analysis, design and implementation of the negotiation protocol. Considerations on how extending one of the analyzed systems in order to move a concrete step towards the realization of an integrated platform for developing negotiation protocols are also provided in the conclusions.
1	Viroli M.; Nardini E.; Castelli G.; Mamei M.; Zambonelli F.	Coordinating spatially-situated pervasive service ecosystems	2011	Technology evolution is providing new pervasive service scenarios characterised by a huge number of distributed and dynamic devices. Accordingly, a new generation of services and infrastructures are emerging which support situatedness, adaptivity and diversity. In this paper we model the overall world of services, data and devices, as a distributed computational ecosystem. Each entity will be modelled as an autonomous, spatially-situated individual of the ecosystem, whose existence is reified by an LSA (Live Semantic Annotation). Ecosystem's behaviour is controlled by coordination rules called eco-laws, which are sort of chemical-like reactions evolving the population of LSAs. We describe an architecture supporting this vision, a formal model of eco-laws, and finally show their usefulness in a scenario of crowd steering through pervasive displays.
	Rosaci D.; Sarné G.M.L.; Garruzzo S.	TRR: An integrated reliability-reputation model for agent societies	2011	Several reliability-reputation models to support agents' decisions have been proposed in the past and many of them combine together reliability and reputation in a synthetic trust measure. In this context, we present a new trust model, called TRR, that considers, from a mathematical viewpoint, the interdependence between these two trust measures. This important feature of TRR is exploited to dynamically compute a parameter determining the importance of the reliability with respect to the reputation. Some experiments performed on the well-known ART platform show the advantages, in terms of effectiveness, introduced by the TRR approach.
	Fortino G.; Garro A.; Russo W.; Vaccaro M.	Performance evaluation of Content Distribution Network architectures through Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation	2011	Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) has emerged as a new and powerful technology for the analysis of natural and artificial complex systems. In this paper ABMS is exploited for the modeling and performance evaluation of Conventional, Clustered and Cooperative Content Distribution Network (CDN) architectures. Clustered and Cooperative architectures differ from Conventional architectures as surrogate servers can loosely (in the Cooperative architectures) or tightly (in the Clustered architectures) cooperate to provide the requested contents to users. The results obtained from the simulation phase show that the Clustered architectures allow for significant improvements of the main CDN performance indices (average user perceived latency, cache hit ratio, and CDN utility) with respect to Conventional and Cooperative architectures.
	Manenti L.; Manzoni S.	Crystals of crowd: Modelling pedestrian groups using MAS-based approach	2011	The paper presents an agent-based model for the explicit representation of groups of pedestrians in a crowd. The model is the result of a multidisciplinary research (CRYSTALS project) where multicultural dynamics and spatial and sociocultural relationships among individuals are considered as first class elements for the simulation of crowd of pilgrims taking to the annual pilgrimage towards Makkah. After an introduction of advantages of Multi-Agent System approach for pedestrian dynamics modelling, a formal description of the model is proposed. The scenario in which the model was developed and some examples about modelling heterogeneous groups of pedestrians are described.
	Bergenti F.; Caire G.; Gotta D.; Long D.; Sacchi G.	Enacting BPM-oriented workflows with Wade	2011	This paper has two main focuses. First it provides a review on the reasons why agent technologies are a good choice for BPM (Business Process Management). A brief survey of the literature on the subject is presented and a critical revision of the main motivations that are commonly accepted for the use of agents in BPM is presented taking into account recent technological developments. Then, the paper presents the recent developments of Wade (Workflow and Agent Development Environment) and it confers such developments and value-added features in the scope of the initial discussion. Finally, the paper briefly enumerates some successful applications of the presented technologies in Telecom Italia. Such applications are so important and demanding that their implementation using agentbased approaches is an outstanding result for agent technology.
	Schaerf A.	A survey of multi-agent systems for optimization problems	2011	Optimization problems, such as resource allocation or scheduling, often involves different entities, such as departments or production units, which might have different constraints and objectives, but are interested in cooperating. In this presentation, we survey various scenarios and the solutions proposed in the literature for this kind of situations. We start from simple distributed constraint satisfaction problems, to move to more complex situations involving contract nets and Markov Decision Problems. Finally, we discuss various kinds of auctions and market mechanisms to solve this kind of problems using a timetabling problem as running example.
	Briola D.; Mascardi V.	Design and implementation of a netlogo interface for the stand-alone FYPA system	2011	FYPA (Find Your Path, Agent!) is a multiagent system currently used by Ansaldo STS for off-line daily computation of paths of trains inside stations. Its exploitation for on-line replanning in case of unavailability of resources is envisaged in the very near future, since the system's performances demonstrated to be suitable for real time usage. In this paper we present StandaFYPA, the stand-alone version of FYPA that we developed for running batteries of tests on our own, without needing to access existing Ansaldo applications. StandaFYPA is equipped with a graphical interface implemented in NetLogo for off-line visualization, that we describe here in details.
	Rosaci D.; Sarné G.M.L.	Supporting evolution in learning information agents	2011	Learning agents can autonomously improve both knowledge and performances by using learning strategies. Recently, a strategy based on a cloning process has been proposed to obtain more effective recommendations, generating advantages for the whole agent community through individual improvements. In particular, users can substitute unsatisfactory agents with others provided with a good reputation and associated with users having similar interests. This approach is able to support an evolutionary behaviour in the community that allows the better agents to predominate over the less productive agents. However, such an approach is user-centric requiring a user's request to clone an agent. Consequently, the approach slowly generates modifications in the agent population. To speed up this evolutive process, a proactive mechanism is proposed in this paper, where the system autonomously identifies for each user those agents that in the community have a good reputation and share the same interests. The user can check the clones of such suggested agents in order to evaluate their performances and to adopt them. The results of preliminary experiments show significant advantages introduced by the proposed approach.
	Talia D.	Cloud computing and software agents: Towards cloud intelligent services	2011	Cloud computing systems provide large-scale infrastructures for high-performance computing that are "elastic" since they are able to adapt to user and application needs. Clouds are used through a service-oriented interface that implements the*-as-a-service paradigm to offer Cloud services on demand. This paper discusses Cloud computing models and architectures, their use in parallel and distributed applications, and examines analogies, differences and potential synergies between Cloud computing and multi-agent systems. This analysis is lead having in mind the goal of implementing highperformance complex systems and intelligent applications by using of Cloud systems and software agents. The convergence of interests between multi-agent systems that need reliable distributed infrastructures and Cloud computing systems that need intelligent software with dynamic, flexible, and autonomous behavior can result in new systems and applications.
	Manenti L.; Manzoni S.; Vizzari G.; Dijkstra J.	Towards modeling activity scheduling in an agent-based model for pedestrian dynamics simulation	2012	In this paper we present an extension of an agent-based model representing pedestrian dynamics in order to include elements related to activity scheduling and the management of events. In particular, we will focus on the guidelines to analyze the scenario, identifying activities and the temporal relationships among them, such as how events that happen in an environment and change its configuration can be represented by means of the operational model and how the decision process of agents is influenced by them. An analysis of modeling activities in a real-word case scenario will be presented.
1	Santi A.; Ricci A.	Programming distributed multi-agent systems in simpAL	2012	Distribution is one of the essential features characterizing multi-agent systems (MASs), giving developers the opportunity to seamlessly conceive and then engineer a physically distributed application as a MAS spread among different network nodes. Nevertheless, the current support given by state-of-the-art Agent Programming Languages (APLs) and related platforms for programming distributed multi-agent systems as well as for handling distribution when deploying, running, debugging the distributed MAS is still quite primitive. In this paper we tackle this problem by introducing simpAL, a new agent-oriented programming language and platform which has been conceived from the beginning to provide a more comprehensive support for programming, deploying and executing physically distributed MASs.
	Capodieci N.; Cabri G.; Pagani G.A.; Aiello M.	Agent modeling of a pervasive application to enable deregulated energy markets	2012	In a not so far future, private houses will be provided with devices that can produce renewable energy, and this will give the owners the chance of selling the unused energy to neighbors. The fact that this selling will be based on peer to peer negotiation (i.e., between single producers and single consumers), will make this market deregulated. This situation could lead to advantages for both producers, who will have an extra income for energy they would not use, and consumers, who can buy cheaper energy than the big companies' one. However, this scenario is very complex and dynamic, and without an appropriate management can lead to odd situations. This paper presents the agent-based modeling of an application to manage the negotiation among different parties producing and consuming energy. We will show that the feature of autonomy of agents well suit the requirements of the proposed scenario. Moreover, we will exploit game theory to define a strategy that try to optimize energy production and supply costs by means of negotiation and learning. By means of simulation of the different parties we will show the effectiveness of the proposed approach; the results show that applying our approach enables to reduce the price of the energy and leads to an equilibrium between expected and real prices.
1	Montagna S.; Viroli M.; Pianini D.; Fernandez-Marquez J.L.	Towards a comprehensive approach to spontaneous self-composition in pervasive ecosystems	2012	Pervasive service ecosystems are emerging as a new paradigm for understanding and designing future pervasive computing systems featuring high degrees of scale, openness, adaptivity and toleration of long-term evolution. A key issue in this context is making certain patterns of behaviour emerge without any supervision or design-time intention, and a primary example is the fully-spontaneous composition of services, possibly at multiple levels. We argue that this can be successfully achieved only by a comprehensive approach exploiting together the main ingredients proposed so far in literature: (i) existence of intelligent components finding proper (semantic) matches of service descriptions, (ii) use of distributed evolutionary techniques to dynamically select appropriate ways of composing services, and (iii) approaches in which rating quality of composition is solely based on their successful exploitation. This proposal is presented through an example of spontaneous composition in crowd steering services.

Behavior predictability despite non-determinism in the SAPERE ecosystem preliminary ideas	2012	How can we have confidence that self organizing systems actually do what we expect them to? In this position paper we overview some mechanisms at the basis of controlling and predicting the behavior of autonomous and self-organizing systems despite components' autonomy and non-deterministic behavior. In particular we focus the analysis on the SAPERE ecosystem as an exemplary model to frame the discussion. We identify three main directions with which to gain confidence on the overall system behavior: (i) confidence from layering, (ii) confidence from large numbers, (iii) confidence form the structure and dynamics of the state space. In the paper we describe this ideas and their implication in the design of self organizing applications.
	Baldoni M.; Baroglio C.	Some thoughts about commitment protocols (position paper)	2012	From the seminal paper by Singh [1], commitments protocols have been raising a lot of attention. The key feature of commitment protocols is their declarative nature, which allows specifying them in a way which abstracts away from any reference to the actual behaviour of the agents. By doing so, commitment protocols respect the autonomy of agents. After more than ten years from the introduction of commitments, it is time to ask (i) if a "commitment to do something" is the only kind of regulative norm, that we need in order to give a social semantics to a physical action, and (ii) if they realize what they promised. In this position paper we discuss these points.

Semantic-based smart homes: A multi-agent approach	2012	Ambient Intelligence aims at autonomic coordination and control of appliances and subsystems located in a given environment. Home and Building Automation (HBA) complies with this paradigm but it is based on an explicit interaction with the user and a static set of operational scenarios. This paper proposes a more flexible multi-agent approach, leveraging semantic-based resource discovery and orchestration in HBA. Backward-compatible enhancements to EIB/KNX domotic standard allow to support the semantic characterization of user profiles and device functionalities, so enabling: (i) negotiation of the most suitable home services/functionalities according to implicit and explicit user needs, (ii) device-driven interaction for adapting the environment to context evolution. A power management problem in HBA is presented as a case study to better clarify the proposal and assess its effectiveness.
	Vizzari G.; Manenti L.; Ohtsuka K.; Shimura K.	Experimental and real world applications of agent-based pedestrian group modeling	2012	The simulation of pedestrian dynamics is a consolidated area of application for agent-based models: successful case studies can be found in the literature and off-the-shelf simulators are commonly employed by decision makers and consultancy companies. These models, however, generally do not consider the explicit representation of pedestrians aggregations (groups), the related occurring relationships and their dynamics. This work is aimed at discussing the relevance and significance of this research effort with respect to the need of empirical data about the implication of the presence of groups of pedestrians in different situations (e.g. changing density, spatial configurations of the environment). The paper describes an agent-based model encapsulating in the pedestrian's behavioural specification effects representing both traditional individual motivations (i.e. tendency to stay away from other pedestrians while moving towards the goal) and a simplified account of influences related to the presence of groups in the crowd. The model is tested in a simple scenario to evaluate the implications of some modeling choices and the presence of groups in the simulated scenario. Moreover, the model is applied in a real world scenario characterized by the presence of organized groups as an instrument for crowd management. Results are discussed and compared to experimental observations and to data available in the literature.

The Indiana MAS project: Goals and preliminary results	2012	The Indiana MAS project, funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research "Futuro in Ricerca 2010" program, aims at providing a framework for the digital protection and conservation of rock art natural and cultural heritage sites, by storing, organizing and presenting information about them in such a way to encourage scientific research and to raise the interest and sensibility towards them from the common people. The project involves two research units, namely Genova (Dipartimento di Informatica, Bioingegneria, Robotica e Ingegneria dei Sistemi) and Salerno (Dipartimento di Matematica e Informatica), for a period of 36 months, starting from march 8th, 2012. The technologies adopted in the project range from agents to ontologies, as requested by the complex nature of the platform, where each module is devoted to a specific task: sketch and symbol recognition, semantic interpretation of complex visual scenes, multi-language text understanding, storing, classification and indexing of multimedia and heterogeneous digital objects. All of them should cooperate and coordinate in order to enable higher level components to reason on them and to detect relationships among different digital objects, hence providing new hypothesis based on such relationships.
1	Casadei M.; Viroli M.	A framework to specify and verify computational fields for pervasive computing systems	2012	Pervasive context-aware computing networks call for designing algorithms for information propagation and reconfiguration that promote self-adaptation, namely, which can guarantee - at least to a probabilistic extent - certain reliability and robustness properties in spite of unpredicted changes and conditions. The possibility of formally analyzing their properties is obviously an essential engineering requirement, calling for general-purpose models and tools. As proposed in recent works, several such algorithms can be modeled by the notion of computational field: a dynamically evolving spatial data structure mapping every node of the network to a data value. Based on this idea, as a contribution toward formally verifying properties of pervasive computing systems, in this article we propose a specification language to model computational fields, and a framework based on PRISM stochastic model checker explicitly targeted at supporting temporal property verification. By a number of pervasive computing examples, we show that the proposed approach can be effectively used for quantitative analysis of systems running on networks composed of hundreds of nodes.

HORUS: An agent system for home automation	2012	This paper presents a system for home automation, called HORUS, which is based on an agent architecture. The benefits deriving from this type of solution are essentially three. Firstly, the agent paradigm provides a good abstraction mechanism for implementing a modular system, easy to configure according to the requirements of a specific application. The second reason is the possibility of scaling up to complex applications exploiting parallel and distributed computing on low power micro-pc. The third reason is load balancing and fault tolerance. When required, the agents migrate from one host to another providing fault tolerance and load balancing capabilities. Some agents are provided with learning capabilities and can learn the model on the environment where they operate. Finally, the agents communicate in xml over https and are integrated in a web environment which offers an ubiquitous access from any kind of portable device, while providing a secure access. HORUS is now a commercial product, which provides either a sophisticated anti-intrusion system, and energy control.
	Franchi E.; Tomaiuolo M.	Software agents for distributed social networking	2012	Especially in the case of completely distributed or federated social networking platforms, multi-agent systems can play an important role. In particular, multi-agent systems have been used as (i) an underlying layer or a middleware for developing social networking platforms, (ii) a technology to increase the autonomous and intelligent behaviour of existing systems and (iii) a tool to develop simulation environments for studying both online and offline human social networks. In this paper we propose the integration of multi-agent technology into Blogracy, a novel peer-to-peer, anonymous and uncensurable social networking platform. The resulting system augments the platform with locality and proximity groups, making it fit for pervasive computing scenarios, exploiting the adaptivity, proactivity and negotiation ability of multi-agent systems.
	Poggi A.	An actor-based software framework for developing and simulating complex systems	2012	ASiDE is an actor-based software framework that has the goals of simplifying the development of large and distributed complex systems and of guarantying an efficient execution of applications. This software framework provides a flexible actor implementation that simplifies the writing of the actors by delegating the management of events (i.e., the reception of messages) to the execution environment, and allowing the choice between an active thread solution (i.e., each actor has its own thread) and a passive thread solution (i.e., several actors share the same thread). In particular, the second thread solution is suitable to implement systems whose behavior should be modeled through the use of a large number of actors. ASiDE is currently used for proving its advantages for the development of agent based modeling and simulation tools.

A multi-agent solution for the interoperability issue in health information systems	2013	To achieve high quality and efficiency standards, interoperability between different information systems in healthcare is strongly required. Distribution, high modularity, robustness are features of agent oriented architectures, making Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) ideal for Health Information Systems (HIS), as the healthcare domain is characterized by system and data heterogeneity. This paper presents an agent oriented architecture to address this kind of issues, capable to access geographically distributed data to allow health professionals to retrieve/update any patient's record efficiently and reliably. The proposed architecture is composed by three layers, to allow local data storage keeping clinical information available by authorized facilities and physicians. Furthermore MAS technology integrates with legacy systems, wrapping them with agents.
	Poggi A.	Replaceable implementations for actor systems	2013	CoDE is an actor-based software framework aimed at both simplifying the development of large and distributed complex systems and guarantying an efficient execution of applications. This software framework takes advantage of a concise actor model that makes easy the development of the actor code by delegating the management of events (i.e., the reception of messages) to the execution environment. Moreover, it allows the development of scalable and efficient applications through the possibility of using different implementations of the components that drive the execution of actors. This paper introduces the software framework and shows how the performance of applications can be optimized by choosing the best combination among the alternative implementations of its components.

Mining the user profile from a smartphone: A multimodal agent framework	2013	Nowadays smartphones play a significant role in gathering relevant data about their owners. Micro-devices embedded in Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) perform a continuous sensing, the phone call lists, PIM (Personal Information Manager), text messages and so on allow to collect and mine data enough for a high-level description of daily activities of a user. This paper proposes an agent able to perform an automated profile annotation by adopting Semantic Web languages. As a proof of concept, the devised agent has been tested in an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) scenario, i.e., a domotic environment where it interacts with its home counterpart to trigger services best matching the user needs. A toy example is presented as case study aiming to better clarify the proposal while an early experimental evaluation is reported to assess its effectiveness.
	De Meo P.; Ferrara E.; Rosaci D.; Sarné G.M.L.	How to improve group homogeneity in Online Social Networks	2013	The formation and evolution of interest groups in Online Social Networks is driven by both the users' preferences and the choices of the groups' administrators. In this context, the notion of homogeneity of a social group is crucial: it accounts for determining the mutual similarity among the members of a group and it's often regarded as fundamental to determine the satisfaction of group members. In this paper we propose a group homogeneity measure that takes into account behavioral information of users, and an algorithm to optimize such a measure in a social network scenario by matching users and groups profiles. We provide an advantageous formulation of such framework by means of a fully-distributed multi-agent system. Experiments on simulated social network data clearly highlight the performance improvement brought by our approach.

Ontology and goal model in designing BDI multi-agent systems	2013	Nowadays several methodological approaches exist, each of them tightly tied up with the implementation platform supporting it. In this paper we propose an intermediate step toward the definition of a methodological approach for supporting the JACAMO framework. This paper resumes a previous work, focused on modeling BDI organizations, and we now address the requirements analysis phase. In particular, we propose the use of an ontological model and a goal model for representing requirements and the domain formalization respectively. The two portions of design process are connected by a heuristic process that allows to extract goals from the ontological model. The resulting models are also used for completing each other and for enhancing the problem description that is considered an input to our process. In the paper we use the well-known case study of the conference management system for illustrating the proposed portion of process.

Understanding the basic mechanisms of spatial coordination is a fundamental issue for coordination models and languages in order to deal with such systems, governing situated interaction in the spatio-temporal fabric. Along this line, in this paper we make space-aware coordination media out of ReSpecT tuple centres, by introducing the few basic mechanisms and constructs that enable the ReSpecT language to face most of the main challenges of spatial coordination in complex software systems.
	Bergenti F.; Caire G.; Gotta D.	An overview of the AMUSE social gaming platform	2013	This paper presents an overview of the novel platform AMUSE (Agent-based Multi-User Social Environment), an agent-based social gaming platform that leverages the power of industrial-strength agent technologies. The core need that motivated the initial work on AMUSE was to provide game developers with a solid tool targeting common horizontal issues in social gaming, like user management and game state management, for games with synchronous and asynchronous interactions. AMUSE fulfills such a need by means of industrial-strength agent technology. Actually, AMUSE is not only a development framework that can be effectively used to implement prototypes and small-scale games with just a few concurrent players. Rather, it is thought as a PaaS (Platform as a Service) tool that enables service provides, like game portals and community portals, to relief game factories from the burden of implementing horizontal functionality that are common to a large set of games. This paper is a first presentation of the work on AMUSE and it starts framing AMUSE into the scope of social gaming. Then, the paper describes the architecture of the multi-agent system that represents the core of AMUSE and it relates the presented agent types with the functionality that AMUSE provides. Finally, the paper outlines some directions of future development.
	Khan S.D.; Crociani L.; Vizzari G.	Integrated analysis and synthesis of pedestrian dynamics: First results in a real world case study	2013	The paper introduces an agent-based model for the simulation of crowds of pedestrians whose main innovative element is the representation and management of an important type of social interaction among the pedestrians: members of groups, in fact, carry out of a form of interaction (by means of verbal or non-verbal communication) that allows them to preserve the cohesion of the group even in particular conditions, such as counter flows, presence of obstacles or narrow passages. The paper formally describes the model and presents its application to a real world scenario in which an analysis of the impact of groups on the overall observed system dynamics was performed. The simulation results are compared to empirical data and they show that the introduced model is able to produce quantitatively plausible results in situations characterised by the presence of groups of pedestrians.

To this aim, it is necessary to provide a normative characterization of coordination and give a social meaning to the agents' actions. We focus on one of the best-known agent platforms, Jade, and show that it is possible to account for the social layer of interaction by exploiting commitment-based protocols, by modifying the Jade Methodology so as to include the new features in a seamless way, and by relying on the notion of artifact, along the direction outlined in the Mercurio proposal. This is a light revision of a paper presented a EMAS 2013.
	Di Napoli C.; Di Nocera D.; Rossi S.	Evaluating negotiation cost for QoS-aware service composition	2013	The value of commercial Service-Based Applications (SBAs) will depend not only on their functionality, but also on the value of their non-functional properties, known as QoS attributes, that are not tied to a specific functionality, but rather to its delivery features. QoS values may vary according to the provision strategies of providers as well as users' requirements expressed as global constraints on the SBA QoS. Automatic negotiation is a viable approach to drive QoS-aware selection of services for SBAs, but its adoption may result computationally expensive due to the communication overhead among the involved negotiators, so limiting its application to real service-based scenarios. In this paper, an empirical evaluation of the impact of negotiation communication costs occurred when composing services to deliver a QoS-aware SBA is carried out, in order to estimate the advantages and disadvantages of negotiation in a market of services, and to identify negotiation parameters settings for which communication costs can be compensated by an increased probability for the negotiation to succeed.

This way, services and resources can be shared in an open environment, and access can be realized on the basis of peer-to-peer trust relationships. The paper also describes a practical implementation of the framework, which integrates a modular trust engine and a rule engine, which is used as a policy checker.
	Pozzi F.A.; Fersini E.; Blanc D.; Messina E.	Enhance polarity classification on social media through sentiment-based feature expansion	2013	Online social networking communities usually exhibit complex collective behaviors. Since emotions play a relevant role in human decision making, understanding how online networks drive human mood states become a task of considerable interest. One of the most relevant task in Sentiment Analysis is Polarity Classification, aimed at classifying the sentiment behind texts. We formulated different assumptions regarding which patterns within a message can be relevant sentiment indicators. Differently from well-formed texts, messages on social networks contain emoticons which could be strong sentiment indicators. For this, the first assumption states that the occurrences of emoticons representing a certain polarity could strongly agree with the overall message polarity. We then expanded the feature space including initialisms for emphatic and onomatopoeic expressions (e.g. bleh, wow, etc.) and "stretched words" (words with a letter repeated several times to emphasize a mood), extensively used in social media messages, because they could be useful information to help in determining the sentiment. Detailed analyses have been performed in order to support our assumptions. Four Machine Learning (supervised) classifiers are applied upon the expanded feature space model. Several experiments show that the considered features lead to increments of accuracy up to 5%.

	Fortino G.; Russo W.	Towards a cloud-assisted and agent-oriented architecture for the Internet of Things	2013	In the Internet of Things (IoT), all things (e.g. sensors, actuators, smart devices, smart objects, RFID, embedded computers, robots) have their identities, physical attributes, and interfaces. They will be seamlessly integrated into the information network such that they will become active participants in business, information and social processes wherever and whenever needed and proper. The technical realization of this vision is a complex challenge as distributed heterogeneous IoT components at different levels of abstractions need to cooperate among themselves, with conventional networked IT infrastructures, and also with human users. To cope with this issue, we propose the synergic exploitation of two complementary mainstream paradigms for large-scale distributed computing: the agent-oriented and the cloud computing paradigms. While the former can support the development of decentralized, dynamic, cooperating and open IoT systems in terms of multi-agent systems, the latter can empower the IoT objects with more computing and memory resources and effectively support system-wide higher-level mechanisms and policies. In this paper, we introduce a cloud-assisted and agent-oriented vision for IoT based on layered reference architecture. Finally, we briefly overview our agent-oriented middleware for cooperating smart objects and a sensor-cloud infrastructure that represent the basic building blocks for technically achieving such vision.

Tuple-based coordination of stochastic systems with uniform primitives	2013	Complex computational systems - such as pervasive, adaptive, and self-organising ones - typically rely on simple yet expressive coordination mechanisms: this is why coordination models and languages can be exploited as the sources of the essential abstractions and mechanisms to build such systems. While the features of tuple-based models make them well suited for complex system coordination, they lack the probabilistic mechanisms for modelling the stochastic behaviours typically required by adaptivity and self-organisation. To this end, in this paper we explicitly introduce uniform primitives as a probabilistic specialisation of standard tuple-based coordination primitives, replacing don't know non-determinism with uniform distribution. We define their semantics and discuss their expressiveness and their impact on system predictability.

Social information retrieval with agents	2014	With the widespread adoption of online social networks as a crucial means for communication, social information retrieval is becoming one of the most interesting areas of research in terms of the large number of-theoretical and practical-issues that it encompasses. We argue that agent technology is central in supporting the decentralization of next generation online social networks and the synergistic pairing of agents and social networks is evident, if nothing else, because members of a social network interact as agents do in a multi-agent system. In this paper we investigate the possibilities that agent technology can offer to social information retrieval and we emphasize the role that agents and multi-agent systems can play by presenting Blogracy, an agent-based online social network system.

In this fashion, our experience is that the use of an ontology in the early stages of the process is a great support for subsequent phases: goal modeling, agent design and implementation. However, we are aware that building and maintaining an ontology has to be supported by appropriate tools. This paper proposes GIMT (Goal Identification and Modeling Tool) as a further step towards the creation of a complete methodological approach for developing multi-agent systems to be implemented in the JACAMO framework. GIMT is a CASE tool for supporting ontology building and goal modeling. Besides the advantages offered by an automatic tool, the other novelty of this research is in the mapping between metamodeling based on Model Driven Engineering (MDE) and Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) with the Eclipse plug-in development environment.

Group recommendation for smart applications: A multi-agent view of the problem	2014	The widespread use of social networks is modifying our way to live our cities and to plan/decide our activities. The long-term goal of our research is to provide users with group recommendation and decision support systems for smart city applications that rely on the analysis of the users' behaviors on social networks/media. In this paper, we provide an overview of the group recommendation literature from a game-theoretical/multiagent system classical point of view, and we present a practical example where a social choice mechanism is extended with social information extracted from the analysis of the interactions, within small groups of users, on a social network. The research leading to these results has received funding from the Italian Ministry of University and Research and EU under the PON OR.C.HE.S.T.R.A. project (ORganization of Cultural HEritage for Smart Tourism and Real-time Accessibility).

Optimization is solved using particle swarm algorithm for various scenarios of operation.
	Nocera D.D.; Napoli C.D.; Rossi S.	A social-aware smart parking application	2014	The problem of finding parking spaces in big urban areas is one of the unsolved challenges of Smart Cities causing traffic congestion, increased carbon emission and time wasting. Network and sensor technologies available today allow to foresee Smart Cities equipped with applications able to provide real-time information on parking space availability, which can be used to assist motorists in looking for a parking space. In the present work, we propose a smart parking application that relies on the use of software agent negotiation as a mechanism to automate the selection of parking spaces according to the user preferences, but at the same time to take into account city needs in terms of areas motorists should avoid, or car pars occupancy at a specific time. Both city needs and user's preferences are dynamic information managed by the negotiation mechanism at the time a user's request is processed, so providing a dynamic-based selection of a parking space.

A stochastic model of self-stabilizing cellular automata for consensus formation	2014	In this paper we present a model of the dynamics of an interesting class of stochastic cellular automata. Such automata are variants of automata used for density classification and they are chosen because they can be effectively used to address consensus problems. After introducing the topic and the basic notation, we study the dynamics of such automata by means of simulations with varying periods and neighborhood structures. We use the results of simulations to extrapolate a stochastic model of the dynamics of such automata that can be used to estimate stabilization time.
1	Messina F.; Pappalardo G.; Santoro C.	Designing autonomous robots using GOLEM	2014	In this paper we present a goal model for the design of autonomous robots. A framework is proposed which allows a developer to design the behaviour of a robot in accordance with a rational model, which is conceived to let the autonomous system to mimic the human behaviour. The framework, called GOLEM, is based on the abstractions of goals and sub-goals, which are combined through specific relationships to specify the robot's activities; such activities, assembled together, form the rational behaviour of the autonomous system. The central motivation for the design of our framework is represented by the central issue of integrating full awareness and autonomy. Indeed, in the proposed solution the execution of goals does not obey a pre-fixed sequence; rather, the next goal to achieve is selected, each time, on the basis of an evaluation of its opportunity.
	Sapienza A.; Falcone R.; Castelfranchi C.	Trust on information sources: A theoretical and computation approach	2014	We start from the claim that trust in information sources is just a kind of social trust. We are interested in the fact that the relevance and the trustworthiness of the information acquired by an agent X from a given number of sources strictly depends and derives from the X's trust on each of these sources with respect the kind of that information. In this paper, we analyze the different dimensions of trust in information sources and formalize the degree of subjective certainty or strength of the X's belief P, considering three main factors: the X's trust about P just depending from the X's judgment of the source's competence and reliability; the sources' degree of certainty about P; and the X's degree of trust that P derives from that given source. Finally we present a computational approach based on fuzzy sets.

A decentralized ant colony foraging model using only stigmergic communication	2014	This paper addresses the problem of foraging by a coordinated team of robots. This coordination is achieved by markers deposited by robots. In this paper, we present a novel decentralized behavioral model for multi robot foraging named cooperative c-marking agent model. In such model, each robot makes a decision according to the affluence of resource locations, either to spread information on a large scale in order to attract more agents or the opposite. Simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms the well-known c-marking agent model.
	Rosaci D.; Sarné G.M.L.	An agent-based architecture to recommend educational video	2014	Agent-based recommender systems are tools able to assist users' choices with suggestions coming closest to their orientations. In this context, it is relevant to identify those users that are the most similar to the target user in order to require them suitable suggestions. However, particularly when we deal with video contents for e-Learning, it should be appropriate also to consider (i) recommendations coming from those students resulted the most effective in suggesting video and (ii) the effects of the device currently exploited. To address such issues in a multimedia scenario, we propose a multi-agent trust based recommender architecture, called ELSA, appositely conceived to this aim. Some preliminary performed simulations permitted to evaluate our proposal with respect to the other considered agentbased RSs.
	Napoli C.; Pappalardo G.; Tramontana E.	An agent-driven semantical identifier using radial basis neural networks and reinforcement learning	2014	Due to the huge availability of documents in digital form, and the deception possibility raise bound to the essence of digital documents and the way they are spread, the authorship attribution problem has constantly increased its relevance. Nowadays, authorship attribution, for both information retrieval and analysis, has gained great importance in the context of security, trust and copyright preservation. This work proposes an innovative multi-agent driven machine learning technique that has been developed for authorship attribution. By means of a preprocessing for word-grouping and timeperiod related analysis of the common lexicon, we determine a bias reference level for the recurrence frequency of the words within analysed texts, and then train a Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBPNN)-based classifier to identify the correct author. The main advantage of the proposed approach lies in the generality of the semantic analysis, which can be applied to different contexts and lexical domains, without requiring any modification. Moreover, the proposed system is able to incorporate an external input, meant to tune the classifier, and then self-adjust by means of continuous learning reinforcement.
	Cervone F.; Sica V.; Staffa M.; Tamburro A.; Rossi S.	Comparing a social robot and a mobile application for movie recommendation: A pilot study	2015	Social robots can be used as interfaces to provide recommendations to users. While a vast literature compares the user's behavior when interacting with a robot with respect to a virtual agent, in this paper, we conduct a first evaluation on how the user's choices are affected if the recommendations are provided respectively by a mobile application or by social robots with different degree of interaction capabilities. This pilot study shows that the sole embodiment condition of the robot does not imply significant changes in the users' choices that prefer to interact with the mobile application. However, the adoption of additional communication channels such as gestures, gaze and voice pitch, which change accordingly to the suggested movie genre, improves the users acceptability.

Recent possibilities of intelligent agents in distributed systems	2015	The article is to discuss recent advances in various aspects of intelligent agents that perform control functions in workflow management and data processing. Cloud-Computing brings various possibilities of novel approach to data management and efficient computer systems, however the process of distribution must be managed not only to increase efficiency but also lower energy consumption. This is a task for intelligent agents, that can play crucial role in modern computer science. In this article recent possibilities for these type of computer systems are discussed.
	Barile F.; Rossi A.; Staffa M.; Di Napoli C.; Rossi S.	A market mechanism for qos-aware multi-robot task allocation	2015	Market mechanisms, such as auctions and negotiations, are often used for efficient task allocation in multi-robot domains where tasks are characterized by quality parameters that are related to the way the task is executed depending on the specific robot capabilities. In these cases, usually robots negotiate their respective assignments in order to optimize task distribution according to their own utility function. In this work, a market-based negotiation mechanism is proposed to allocate tasks to a set of robots by taking into account end-to-end requirements that the complete allocation should meet in terms of the considered quality parameters. Negotiation takes place on these parameters that are considered goods to be traded by the individual robots, depending on their strategies, so that they can successfully negotiate to obtain the task allocation.

This paper presents a hybrid agent architecture employing a Floor Field approach at the operational level but granting agents an abstract representation of the simulated environment. The paper briefly presents the environmental model and hybrid agent architecture based on the floor field approach, then a sample practical application in a simple case study is also presented to show how it allows specifying abstract behavioural scripts for different groups of agents.
	Fornaia A.; Napoli C.; Pappalardo G.; Tramontana E.	An AO system for OO-GPU programming	2015	Recent technologies, like general purpose computing GPU, have a major limitation consisting in the difficulties that developers face when implementing parallel code using device-oriented languages. This paper aims to assist developers by automatically producing snippets of code handling GPU-oriented tasks. Our proposed approach is based on Aspect-Oriented-Programming and generates modules in CUDA C compliant code, which are encapsulated and connected by means of JNI. By means of a set of predefined functions we separate the application code from device-dependent concerns, including device memory allocation and management. Moreover, bandwidth utilisation and cores occupancy is automatically handled in order to minimise the overhead caused by host to device communications and the computational imbalance, which often tampers with the effective speedup of a GPU parallelised code.
	Monica S.; Bergenti F.	Simulations of opinion formation in multi-agent systems using kinetic theory	2015	In this paper we formulate the problem of opinion formation using a physical metaphore. We consider a multiagent system where each agent is associated with an opinion and interacts with any other agent. Interpreting the agents as the molecules of a gas, we model the evolution of opinion in the system according to a kinetic model based on the analysis of interactions among agents. From a microscopic description of each interaction between two agents, we derive the stationary profiles of the opinion under given assumption. Results show that, depending on the average opinion and on the parameters of the model, different profiles can be found, but all stationary profiles are characterized by the presence just of one or two maxima. Analytic results are confirmed by simulations shown in the last part of the paper.
	Amato A.; Scialdone M.; Venticinque S.	An application of learning agents to smart energy domains	2015	The main requirement for building an Internet of Things is the definition of smart objects in which it needs to put intelligence. The pervasive deployment of smart objects will add value to applications by capabilities of communication, negotiation, learning and distributed reasoning. In this paper we investigate how the paradigm shift from objects to agents is the driver for developing these capabilities by a case study in the context of Smart Energy application domain. In fact the paradigm shift we are seeing in these years is to consider the electricity network like an Internet of Energy, where each and every electrical device and generator will be connected in a network and able to communicate data and receive and react in real time to events and stimuli that arrive from other devices or from the grid: a scattered network of sensors, actuators, communication nodes, systems control and monitoring. Here we present the learning-based approach for power management in smart grids providing an agent-oriented modeling of the energy market. The main issue we focus on is a reasonable compromise between the resolution of the consuming profile representation and the performance and real time requirements of the system.

1	Crociani L.; Piazzoni A.; Vizzari G.	Adaptive hybrid agents for tactical decisions in pedestrian environments	2015	This paper presents a hybrid agent architecture for modeling different types of decisions in a pedestrian simulation system. In particular, the present work focuses on tactical level decisions that are essentially related to the choice of a route to follow in an environment comprising several rooms connected by openings. These decisions are then enacted at the operational level by mean of a floor-field based model, in a discrete simulation approach. The described model allows the agent taking decisions based on a static a-priori knowledge of the environment and dynamic perceivable information on the current level of crowdedness of visible path alternatives. The paper presents the model formally, motivating the adopted choices with reference to the relevant state of the art. The model is also experimented in benchmark scenarios showing the adequacy in providing adaptiveness to the contextual situation.

Coordination of large-scale socio-technical systems: Challenges and research directions	2015	Most of the emerging software-intensive systems nowadays are very large-scale ones, and inherently socio-technical. In this position paper, we argue that the peculiar features of such emerging systems (up to millions of interacting components, lacking central control, mixing humans and artificial components) call for novel approaches to coordinate the overall activities and functionalities. Accordingly, we discuss the key challenges to be faced by research in coordination models and technologies, and try to sketch some promising research directions.

The formalism we use for representing the expected patterns of actions along with exceptions, timeouts, and their handlers, is that of constrained global types extended with features for dealing with these new constructs. We provide the syntax and semantics of the extended constrained global types and examples of their use, in the different contexts of fail-uncontrolled and AmI systems.

Mobile agents with recurrent neural networks-based computing model for echo cancellation problem	2015	The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to a novel solving method for AEC problem and to search for a solution based on mobile agents (MAs) technology. Several applications benefit already by the use of MAs technology and we now want to join a soft computing technology as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for this problem's area in communication systems. In this paper we propose a MAs with RNNs-based, so as pipelined recurrent neural networks (PRNNs), computing model for AEC's problem in communication systems. Prediction of echo paths can be performed by RNNs and PRNNs based processing. The results about the faced problem in communication systems, where the use of MAs with RNNs implementation might be an improvement over a more conventional solutions, are here summarized, presented and evaluated. Satisfactory performance in echo cancellation were obtained. The two echo signals input, as echo remote and echo local are provided as inputs to the RNN and PRNN and the echo output prediction shows a relevant reduction evaluated as 60 db.

	Murano A.; Sorrentino L.	A game-based model for human-robots interaction	2015	Game theory has exhibited to be a fruitful metaphor to reason about multi-player systems. Two kinds of games are mainly studied and adopted: turn-based and concurrent. They differ on the way the players are allowed to move. However, in real scenarios, there are very simple interplays among players whose modeling does not fit well in any of these settings. In this paper we introduce a novel game-based framework to model and reason about the interaction between robots and humans. This framework combines all positive features of both turn-based and concurrent games. Over this game model we study the reachability problem. To give an evidence of the usefulness of the introduced framework, we use it to model the interaction between a human and a team of two robots, in which the former tries to run away from the latter. We also provide an algorithm that decides in polynomial time whether at least one robot catches the human.
	Busetta P.; Dragoni M.	Composing cognitive agents from behavioural models in PRESTO	2015	The PRESTO project applies agent technologies to serious gaming. PRESTO has developed an AI infrastructure and an agent framework called DICE for the creation of game-independent, modular Non-Player Characters (NPC) behaviours based on a BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) approach enriched with cognitive extensions for human simulation. Behavioural models can be combined via end-user development tools to form the behavioural profiles of NPCs in a game. DICE provides the coordination between body-controlling behavioural models (for navigation as well as posture, facial expressions, actioning) and decision-making models representing e.g. the standard operating procedures of professional roles, the cognitive appraisal of events and perceptions, the modality of reaction to unplanned events occurring during a game. Behavioural models are largely if not completely independent of the specific scenario or even game engine thanks to abstractions of both the environment and the internal state of the NPC provided by means of ontologies. PRESTO is producing a set of behavioural models targeted at its pilot project's needs or expected to be of common use, including navigation in the virtual environment sensitive to the cognitive state of the NPC. This paper gives a brief overview of PRESTO, DICE and of its ontologies.

	Sapienza A.; Falcone R.; Castelfranchi C.	The positive power of prejudice: A computational model for MAS	2015	In MAS studies on Trust building and dynamics the role of direct/personal experience and of recommendations and reputation is proportionally overrated; while the importance of inferential processes in deriving the evaluation of trustees' trustworthiness is underestimated and not enough exploited. In this paper we focus on the importance of generalized knowledge: agents' categories. The cognitive advantage of generalized knowledge can be synthesized in this claim: "It allows us to know a lot about something/somebody we do not directly know". At a social level this means that I can know a lot of things on people that I never met; it is social "prejudice" with its good side and fundamental contribution to social exchange. In this study we experimentally inquire the role played by categories' reputation with respect to the reputation and opinion on single agents: when it is better to rely on the first ones and when are more reliable the second ones. Our claim is that: the larger the population and the ignorance about the trustworthiness of each individual (as it happens in an open world) the more precious the role of trust in categories. In particular, we want investigate how the parameters defining the specific environment (number of agents, their interactions, transfer of reputation, and so on) determine the use of categories' reputation. This powerful inferential device has to be strongly present in WEB societies.
	Fornaia A.; Napoli C.; Pappalardo G.; Tramontana E.	Using AOP neural networks to infer user behaviours and interests	2015	Generally, users of an 'ego' social network provide personal information and actively participate in groups to discuss some topic. We propose a multi-agent driven system to analyse user behaviour and interests by gathering data related to different activities and show that a more comprehensive identity can be built from sparse data, while possibly reveal the tentative of some users to deceive other people. In our approach, user profiles are given to a profiling agent that retains relevant data by using ANN technologies that find categories for users. Even new users, whose profile is still mostly undefined, are given a 'most-likely' category, therefore the traits of such a category are inferred for new users. Since a group in a social network such as Facebook can be seen as a category, the agent driven system is also able to classify user profiles and recommend new groups users can subscribe to, according to their interests and preferences.

Self-organising UAVs for wide area fault-tolerant aerial monitoring	2015	This paper describes an algorithm for the coordination of a flock of multirotor UAVs which cooperate in performing a wide area monitoring mission. The key characteristics of the proposed approach are the self-organising ability and the decentralisation. The flock has the basic task of covering a certain area of terrain and is able to self-organise in order to (i) find a coverage of the area which minimises mission time, and (ii) identify possible faults in one or more multirotors, taking care of performing a re-scouting of proper terrain regions in order to avoid loss of data. The algorithms to ensure flocking formation and area coverage are described. They are also validated by means of simulation approach, which is performed using an ad-hoc software tool.
	Fortino G.; Russo W.; Savaglio C.	Simulation of agent-oriented internet of things systems	2016	The proliferation of everyday smart devices able to sense, process, communicate and/or actuate, is changing the way we interact with the world around us. These novel cyber-physical smart devices, or simply Smart Objects (SOs), are the fundamental building blocks of the Internet of Things (IoT), a global and highly dynamic ecosystem in which heterogeneous typologies of device networks seamlessly interoperate. Although the IoT component technologies and enabling computing paradigms are not totally new, the development and analysis of an IoT system is still a complex process. In this paper the ACOSO (Agent-based COoperative Smart Object) middleware and the Omnet++ platform have been used as means for the SObased IoT systems development/management and simulation. Indeed, on one hand ACOSO provides effective instruments and a simple programming model to realize both cyber-physical SOs and IoT systems. On the other hand, leveraging on the parallelism between SOs/agents and the Omnet++ network nodes, simulations of agent-oriented IoT systems in different scale scenarios have been defined and conducted.
	Iotti E.; Poggi A.; Tomaiuolo M.	Agent based P2P social networks modeling	2016	Nowadays, social networks are the most important means for the interaction between people on the Web. The large part of such networks are deployed on a centralized architecture that allows a simple browser-based user experience and, moreover, many algorithms, e.g., friend suggestion, are far easier and more efficient to implement in this setting. Peer-topeer social networks do not exploit a central server for storing users' data. Therefore, their development and maintenance is more difficult, but they enable users to have more control on their profile content, ensuring a higher level of privacy. The main challenge of such a kind of network comes from guaranteeing availability of the data of the user profiles when their owners are offline. Different solutions have been proposed, but each of them presents advantages and drawbacks (e.g., data availability vs. cost). In this paper we present our preliminary work on the design of a peer-to-peer social network architecture that took advantage of an actor based development system for the modelling and analysis of a set of possible algorithms that can support the availability of the profiles of the offline users in the social network.
	Sapienza A.; Falcone R.	A Bayesian computational model for trust on information sources	2016	In this work we want to provide a tool for handling information coming from different information sources. In fact the real world we often have to deal with different sources asserting different things and, in order to decide, it is necessary to consider properly each of them trying to put this information together. According to us, a good way to do it is exploiting the concept of trust. In fact using it as a valve, it is possible to give a different weight to what the source is reporting. Plus we decide to implement this trust model as generic as possible. In this way, the model can be used in different context and within different practical applications. After presenting the theoretical and the computational model, we also show a practical example of how to use it, to let the reader better understand the overall workflow.

Supporting learners-to-lerners interactions basing on online social networks information	2016	E-Learning students can benefit from proper class formation process based on the student needs. In particular, Online Social Networks make available data concerning users' interactions, as skills and trust relationships, that are behind the dynamics of thematic social network groups, and can be explouted to form e-Learning classes. To this aim, we propose a model based on such information, which are properly combined to support the dynamics of e-Learning classes on Online Social Networks. The approach provide a way to give suggestions to users about the best classes to join with and to class adminastrors the best students to accept. The proposed approach has been tested by simulating an e-Learning scenario within a large social network by showing its capability to satisfy all the actors.

MAS-DRiVe: A practical approach to decentralized runtime verification of agent interaction protocols	2016	We address the problem of decentralized runtime verification of interaction protocols in multiagent systems by means of MAS-DRiVe, an algorithm for partitioning a multiagent system (MAS) into sub-MASs which can be monitored independently. Given a global interaction protocol named AIP (for "Agent Interaction Protocol") describing all the interactions which can take place in the MAS, the MAS-DRiVe algorithm extracts the interaction graph from AIP, identifies the clusters of agents which cannot be split during the decentralized monitoring as the interactions they are involved in are not independent, collapses each of those clusters into a single node in the interaction graph, and finally partitions the collapsed graph obtained so far. Although the "unsplittable agents identification" stage is still in its early design and prototyping phases and requires a better formalization and a deeper analysis, the MAS-DRiVe algorithm pipeline has been fully implemented and demonstrated on two simple MASs. Once the independently monitorable sub-MASs have been identified by MAS-DRiVe, the global interaction protocol AIP can be projected onto the subsets of agents belonging to each graph partition, thus obtaining local versions of AIP which can be monitored in a decentralized way.

PyGenbot for IoT: A demonstration of how to generate any restricted stateless AIML FAQ-chatter bot from text files	2016	Internet of things applications (IoT) are required to interact with the user in the best natural possible way; the voice based conversation is the ultimate human-machine interaction in terms of easy to use and requirements from the user part, which also has the advantage for the user to interact hands free, non necessary watching a computer screen. Chatter bots are conversational agents that simulate, and capable to sustain, a conversation with a human. Technology do exists that allows to create a lexical knowledge base to be used by a restricted chatter bot, i.e. expert on a specific dominion. This work shows a methodology of restricted chatbot generation using Python program, called PyGenbot, that is capable to derive an AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) knowledge base starting from a simple textual data set, including: a FAQ, a keywords, a stopwords, a multiwords and a glossary file set. Any WOA attendee is welcome to supply arbitrary and simple formatted text files; then using PyGenbot, I will first edit the text input files needed to generate automatically the corresponding AIML knowledge base set that can be used with any standard AIML interpreter to implement the desired chatter bot, which can then be integrated into an IoT application.

AgentSimJS: A web-based multi-agent simulator with 3D capabilities	2016	This paper describes the architecture of AgentSimJs, a web-based multi-agent simulator written in Javascript. The simulator is capable to render a 3D scene with objects and agents and allows the programmer to arrange simulations by specifying the behavior of agents. The architecture of AgentSimJs is highly modular, as several different components have been designed to enrich the simulator with the desired functionalities. AgentSimJs also has the capability of distributing the simulation among different machines and/or different thread, forming group of agents for broadcast communications.
	Monica S.; Bergenti F.	Analytic study of opinion dynamics in multi-agent systems with two classes of agents	2016	This paper describes a model for opinion dynamics in multi-agent systems composed of two classes of agents. Each class is characterized by distinctive values of the parameters that govern opinion dynamics. The proposed model is inspired by kinetic theory of gases, according to which macroscopic properties of gases are described starting from microscopic interactions among molecules. By interpreting agents as molecules of gases, and their interactions as collisions among molecules, the equations that govern kinetic theory can be reinterpreted to model opinion dynamics in multi-agent systems. A key feature of the adopted kinetic-based approach is that it allows macroscopic properties of the system to be derived analytically. In order to take into account that the considered multi-agent system is composed of two classes of agents, kinetic theory of gas mixtures, which deals with gases composed of different kinds of molecules, is adopted. Presented results show that consensus is reached after a sufficiently large number of interactions, which depends on the parameters associated with the two classes of agents.
	Postorino M.N.; Sarné G.M.L.	Agents meet traffic simulation, control and management: A review of selected recent contributions	2016	In the last decades, transport demand has increased quickly due to several concurrent factors. The negative impacts of increased demand have many effects on both travelers themselves and communities and some actions need to mitigate them. To this purpose, progresses in different scientific fields as computer science, electronic, communication as well as studies on new and more sophisticated traffic simulation models contributed to realize Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs), which provide advanced transport services for a better and efficient use of transport networks. The adoption of the software agent technology has given a significant contribution to the ITS development, due to their capability to both simulate traffic scenarios at different levels of detail and provide intelligent decision-making frameworks. Intelligent agents make it possible to study human behaviors and machine-to-machine interactions with the aim to simulate, control and manage transportation networks. Given their relevance, in the last years a great body of researches and surveys have been proposed in the literature on this matter. This paper wants to contribute by providing an overview of the most significant advancements produced during the period 2013-2015.
	Yazdanpanah V.; Dastani M.	Quantified group responsibility in multi-agent systems	2016	This paper1 builds on an existing notion of group responsibility and proposes two ways to define the degree of group responsibility: structural and functional degrees of responsibility. These notions measure potential responsibilities of agent groups for avoiding a state of affairs. According to these notions, a degree of responsibility for a state of affairs can be assigned to a group of agents if, and to the extent that, the group of the agents have potential to preclude the state of affairs. These notions will be formally specified and their properties will be analyzed.
	Mariani S.; Omicini A.	Game engines to model MAS: A research roadmap	2016	Game engines are gaining increasing popularity in various computational research areas, and in particular in the context of multi-agent systems (MAS)-for instance, to render augmented reality environments, improve immersive simulation infrastructures, and so on. Existing examples of successful integration between game engines and MAS still focus on specific technology-level goals, rather than on shaping a general-purpose game-based agent-oriented infrastructure. In this roadmap paper, we point out the conceptual issues to be faced while attempting to exploit game engines as agent-oriented infrastructures, and outline a possible research roadmap to follow, backed up by some early experiments involving the Unity3D engine.
	Bergenti F.; Iotti E.; Monica S.; Poggi A.	A case study of the JADEL programming language	2016	This paper presents and discusses a first complete example of the use of JADEL. JADEL is a novel agent-oriented domain-specific programming language built on top of JADE, the well-known agent platform which provides solid agent technology and several tools for the creation of agents and multi-agent systems. The purpose of JADEL is to make the development of JADE agents and multi-agent systems easier and clearer by means of specific abstractions and a lighter syntax. In order to understand, and properly assess, the actual advantages of using JADEL, a well-known JADE demo that uses JADEspecific features like ontologies and interaction protocols has been rewritten in JADEL. This paper first briefly presents the main features of JADEL, then it discusses the rewritten demo and compares it with original JADE code.
	Calegari R.; Denti E.; Mariani S.; Omicini A.	Towards logic programming as a service: Experiments in tuprolog	2016	In this paper we explore the perspective of Logic Programming as a Service (LPaaS), with a broad notion of "service" going beyond the mere handling of the logic engine lifecycle, knowledge base management, reasoning queries execution, etc. In particular, we present tuProlog as-a-service, a Prolog engine based on the tuProlog core made available as an encapsulated service to effectively support the spreading of intelligence in pervasive systems-mainly, Internet-of-Things (IoT) application scenarios. So, after recalling the main features of tuProlog technology, we discuss the design and implementation of tuProlog as-a-service, focussing in particular on the iOS platform because of the many supported smart devices (phones, watches, etc.), the URL-based communication support among apps, and the multi-language resulting scenarios.
1	Robol M.; Giorgini P.; Busetta P.	Applying social norms to implicit negotiation among non-player characters in serious games	2016	Believable Non Player Characters (NPCs), i.e. artificial characters simulating rational entities, are a great addition to videogames, no matter if used for entertainment or serious reasons. Especially NPCs that represent people in realistic settings need to show plausible behaviors; to this end, one of main issues to be tackled is coordination with other participants, either other NPCs or human players, when performing everyday tasks such as crossing doors, queuing at an office, picking the first free object up from a set, and so on. Much of this coordination happens silently and is driven by social norms that may vary according to culture and context. In this paper, we propose an approach to represent social norms in autonomous agents and enable implicit coordination driven by observations of others' behavior. Our approach does not use central coordinators or a coordination protocol, but rather let each agent take its own decision so to support more realistic interactions with human players. A software architecture and initial experimental results are presented and discussed.
	Messina F.; Sarné F.A.	A group catalog mechanism to promote knowledge sharing in open virtual communities	2016	In open virtual communities, thematic groups promote mutual cooperation among their members in order to reach specific targets. To this purpose, users share portions of their knowledge in a reciprocal understandable manner. For this aim, personal software agents are able to assist users by encoding personal information about preferences and goals into suitable profiles. In this work we present a multi-agent solution to manage knowledge shared by users across a number of common thematic groups. A common catalog is created for each thematic group of interest that, in turn, is associated with a group agent. The group agent is devoted to support the group by interacting with personal agents in order to manage the group affiliation process and enrich the common thematic catalog of its own group. In presence of heterogeneous agents, such a common group catalog is a key element to provide knowledge sharing and agent interoperability with both other personal and the group agents. In the proposed approach each user agent is able to personalize its own catalog and contribute to enrich that of its own group by collaborating with its group agent.
	Zambonelli F.	Towards a discipline of IoT-Oriented software engineering	2016	Despite the rapid progresses in IoT research, a general principled software engineering approach for the systematic development of IoT systems and applications is still missing. In this article, by synthesizing form the state of the art in the area, we attempt at framing the key concepts and abstractions that revolve around the design and development of IoT systems and applications, and that could represent the ground on which to start shaping the guidelines of a new IoT-oriented software engineering discipline.
	Rossi S.; Di Napoli C.; Barile F.; Liguori L.	Conflict resolution profiles and agent negotiation for group recommendations	2016	The pervasive use of web technologies and online cooperation tools is posing new challenges in the design of recommender systems, requiring now a rapid move from individual to group recommendations. In this paper, a multi-agent system to provide support to small groups of users in their decisionmaking process is presented. In detail, the addressed problem is to find a common solution for a group, represented by a set of activities in the touristic domain, among a huge set of possible alternatives, that meets the preferences of each member. The proposed system uses an automatic negotiation process that incrementally builds a candidate solution for the whole group according to the individual lists of each group member. Since the negotiation mechanism involves the real users to take part in the decision-making process, the proposed approach tries to limit the agreement search space during the negotiation process in order to minimize the user direct intervention. The proposed solution relies on negotiating agents that simulate the users' behavior while trading by using different conflict resolution styles, obtained by applying the Thomas Kilmann model. The results obtained with both simulated and real users' behavior show that the proposed system achieves a high probability of success, finding a shared solution, in most cases, in a relatively small number of rounds of negotiation. In addition, end users were satisfied with the received recommendations.
	Baldoni M.; Baroglio C.; Capuzzimati F.; Micalizio R.	Endowing business artifacts with a normative coordination layer	2017	We propose to enrich the artifact-centric approach in two ways. First, by relying on the Agent-Oriented Paradigm, the tasks acting on artifacts are organized in agents, seen as autonomous loci of control, whose execution is goal-driven. Second, the business artifact model is complemented by a normative dimension. Norms are used to represent the data lifecycle in a form that is inspectable and that can be reasoned upon by agents. Agents can therefore create expectations about the behaviors of others and hence, leveraging on the norms, agents can act on an artifact so as to entice, or oblige, others to act themselves. The paper discusses the advantages and consequences of this norm-aware enrichment, and outlines a possible realization based on social commitments.
	De Meo P.; Messina F.; Rosaci D.; Sarné G.M.L.	Improving agent group homogeneity over time	2017	In social communities the composition of thematic groups varies over time due to changes occurring in users' behaviors. To study the time evolution of such a process, we design a conceptual framework exploiting a distributed algorithm driving group formation. The results of tests carried out on real data extracted by the social network CIAO, show as groups formed by combining similarity and trust measures are i) more time-stable, independently by the weight of the trust component, and ii) more time-homogeneous, independently by the presence of uncorrelated random agents' behaviors affecting the similarity component.
	De Benedetti M.; D'Urso F.; Messina F.; Pappalardo G.; Santoro C.	3D simulation of unmanned aerial vehicles	2017	This paper describes the software architecture of a multi-agent simulator specifically designed to simulate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The simulator has the aim of helping a developer to design a multi-agent application in which a team or flock of UAVs are employed for a certain mission in an environment. The basic feature of the described tool is the ability to simulate the real physics and dynamics of the entities involved (UAVs), not only by emulating real reactions to forces and torques but also showing the UAVs in a 3D view. The simulator provides the basic classes handling stabilization and control of a quadrotor UAV and let the developer to design her/his application by concentrating only on behavioral aspects of the entities. As usual in multi-agent applications, in order to handle interactions among UAVs, a set of classes is included to simulate a wireless communication system with a certain latency and packet loss probability. The simulator can be also executed without the visualization engine in order to run simulations (that could require a long time to complete) in headless servers. The paper also includes a case-study of a flocking application.
	Agnello L.; Cossentino M.; De Simone G.; Sabatucci L.	A self-adaptation exemplar: The shipboard power system reconfiguration problem	2017	In a vessel, the Shipboard Power System (SPS) is responsible for supplying energy to various services, such as navigation and communication. A research topic is the reconfiguration of the electrical scheme in case of either failure or damage. Indeed, after a fault, the software control system must ensure the ship's survival. In a couple of earlier studies, we: (i) analyzed the relation between the electrical schema and the software control system and (ii) identified many common characteristics between the SPS problem and Self-Adaptive Systems domain. In particular, a systematic classification of the approaches for reconfiguration highlighted the need of environment monitors, decision-making procedures and a feedback loop among the others. The purpose of this paper is to frame the SPS reconfiguration as a self-adaptive exemplar by highlighting scenarios, tasks, norms goals and quality aspects with the support of the IEEE specifications. The exemplar may serve for a twofold aim: (i) the SPS may be a new field to compare self-adaptive procedures, and, on the other side, novel self-adaptive approaches may improve the state-of-the-art in SPS reconfiguration.
	Comi A.; Rosaci D.	SMARTSAN: A P2P social agent network for generating recommendations in a smart city environment	2017	The rapid advances of the Internet of Things (IoT) has implied that new kind of social networks are becoming pervasive, and the use of the multi-agent technology has been recognized to have a key role in designing distributed software architecture capable of implementing autonomous, adaptive and proactive services for the citizens, with high levels of effectiveness and efficiency.In this scenario, we can imagine the possibility to form groups of agents associated with users and objects that are geographically close, and use these groups to provide the users with recommendations about services of potential interest.In this paper, we propose a novel recommender system for smart city environments, based on a P2P social agent network, designed to faced these highlighted problems. The P2P network topology is continuously adapted to the changes of desires and necessities of the users, using an algorithm that match the different exigences for forming groups of agents geographically close with each other. Moreover, in order to consider also the issue (ii) above, the local groups are integrated in a global social network, that can be used to discover services of interest for a given user also managed by agents that do not belong to the same local group of the user.
	Monica S.; Bergenti F.	An analytic model of the impact of skeptical agents on the dynamics of compromise	2017	This paper studies analytically the dynamics of the opinion in multi-agent systems where two classes of agents coexist. The fact that the population of considered multi-agent systems is divided into two classes is meant to account for agents with different propensity to change their opinions. Skeptical agents, which are agents that are not inclined to change their opinions, can be modeled together with moderate agents, which are agents that are moderately open to take into account the opinions of the others. The studied analytic model of opinion dynamics involves only compromise, which describes how agents change their opinions to try to reach consensus. The adopted model of compromise is stochastic in order to give agents some level of autonomy in their decisions. Presented results show, analytically, that after a sufficient number of interactions consensus is reached, regardless of the initial distribution of the opinion. Analytic results are confirmed by simulations shown in the last part of the paper.

The system consists of an electrical power supply generated from the anaerobic digestion of biomass. It also includes the storage of electrical energy in a superconducting magnetic energy storage device in order to overcome energy blackout and meet the energy needs of the network when the demand rises in closed-cycle production systems. Finally, an agent platform of remote control should monitor the whole system in the future.

	Barbaro G.; Gangemi M.D.; Foti G.	An agent-based tsunami alert system	2017	Natural tsunami catastrophes occurred over the years have developed the interest in studying the associated physical phenomena in order to refine existing modeling tools and enhance alert mechanisms. To this purpose, it is essential to carry out an adequate risk analysis for the most exposed areas and therefore to study any historical event that may provide useful indications on the dynamics of the area. To this aim, recently, a fully nonlinear and dispersive long wave model FUNWAVE-TVD and a 3D (sigma-coordinate) non-hydrostatic model NHWAVE were respectively proposed to simulate the tsunami propagation and its slide generation. However, these models require to analyze a great amount of data coming both i) by wavemeters, which measures the sea anomalies in real time, and ii) by historical data. Given the complexity of these tasks, in this paper we propose to adopt the agent technology to verify the wavemeters reliability and to analyze the results of the models cited above in order to realize a reliable tsunami alert system.

A study to promote car-sharing by adopting a reputation system in a multi-agent context	2017	In recent years the increasing rate of vehicular traffic due to private mobility caused congestion and environmental impacts in urban contexts all over the world. To face such problems an important contribution might be given by transit systems. However, transit systems are characterized by a discontinuous spatial and time coverage so that other forms of mobility, like car-sharing, can be an effective complement to it by providing the same flexibility and comfort of private cars. Several studies confirmed that car-sharing is almost as highly appreciated as private cars but having the advantage of lower costs. For such reasons, in recent years the car-sharing market increased continuously as it has been resulting more and more attractive for investors, although its market share remains limited. To encourage the car-sharing philosophy, from one hand traditional car-sharing companies are trying to reduce operational costs to offer lower fares and, from the other hand, several individual owners are starting to share their cars suitably supported by technology. To promote car-sharing activities, in this paper a multi-agent system able to monitor car-sharing users' driving habits is proposed. In particular, agents assist users in improving their driving, as well as in building their individual reputation measures over time. Such reputation scores can be used to allow the access to car-sharing services and personalized fares. Experiments on real and simulated data are encouraging and show the potentiality of this proposal.
	Fotia L.	Generating trust-based recommendations for social networks organized by groups	2017	Evidence suggests that people often waver to buy from online vendors because of uncertainty about vendor behavior or the risk of having wrong information about the products. Trust plays a central role in helping consumers overcome perceptions of risk. Moreover, thematic groups are gaining a lot of attention and high centrality in online community, as users share opinions and/or mutually collaborate for reaching their targets. The users can be helped by personal software agents able to perform activities aimed at supporting the purchase of products. This paper proposes a new trust measure in social networks organized by groups. In particular, we present a model to represent this scenario, and we introduce an algorithm for detecting trust recommendations in virtual communities in presence of groups. We technically formalize our idea and show a complete example of how our approach works.
	Fortino G.; Russo W.; Savaglio C.; Viroli M.; Zhou M.	Modeling opportunistic IoT services in open IoT ecosystems	2017	Internet of Thing (IoT) is transforming our physical world into a giant information system, daily providing novel, advanced, cyberphysical services. Differently from conventional computing services (e.g., web-services, and ubiquitous services) that are usually loosely impacted by contextawareness, co-location or transience, Internet of Things (IoT) services require to actually consider the overall spatio-temporal context of the heterogeneous entities involved in the service provisioning. This paper proposes a novel and full-fledged approach to IoT service modeling, aiming to fully support IoT service development according to opportunistic properties.

Motivations for interest range from commercial marketing to the monitoring of social trends and political opinions. This work presents an actorbased platform, augmented with machine learning algorithms. To evaluate its possible application for the continuous analysis of social media streams, we also present a case study about sport. We argue that the actor paradigm allows modeling well this kind of scenario, and it can scale to more complex applications, where multiple actors can cooperate to realize structured analysis tools. Results also show the advantage of a system for continuous analysis, which can learn from new data and improve its internal classification model.
	Falcone R.; Sapienza A.	How can subjective impulsivity play a role among information sources in weather scenarios?	2017	The topic of critical hydrogeological phenomena, due to flooding, has a particular relevance given the risk that it implies. In this paper we simulated complex weather scenarios in which forecasts coming from different sources become relevant. Our basic idea is that agents can build their own evaluations on the future weather events integrating these different information sources also considering how trustworthy each single source is with respect to each individual agent. These agents learn the sources' trustworthiness in a training phase. Moreover, agents are differentiated on the basis of their own ability to make direct weather forecasts, on their possibility to receive bad or good forecasts from the authority, and on the possibility of being influenced by the neighbors' behaviors. Quite often in the real scenarios some irrational behaviors rise up, whereby individuals tend to impulsively follow the crowd, regardless of its reliability. To model that, we introduced an impulsivity factor that measures how agents are influenced by the neighbors' behavior, a sort of "crowd effect". The results of these simulations show that, thanks to a proper trust evaluation of their sources made in the training phase, the different kinds of agents are able to better identify the future events.
	Fotia L.; Messina F.; Rosaci D.; Sarné G.M.L.	On the impact of trust relationships on social network group formation	2017	Members of virtual communities generally expect that their groups satisfy some given requirements. For this aim, the profile matching between user requirements and group characteristics can be considered as the most natural way to represent the group homogeneity, measuring how much the group members are mutually linked. However, optimizing profile matching does not guarantee that the group will continue to be homogeneous in time (i.e., cohesive). In the past we have already shown that, when group formation is driven by trust measures and profile matching group homogeneity is improved. In this work, we prove by experiments on a dataset extracted from a real social network, that trust measures can be used to effectively replace profile matching for optimizing group's cohesion. Furthermore, we prove also that using a local trust measure will does not penalize the cohesion of the group.
1	Bergenti F.; Iotti E.; Monica S.; Poggi A.	Overview of a formal semantics for the JADEL programming language	2017	This paper outlines a first proposal of a formal semantics for the JADEL programming language. JADEL is an agent-oriented programming language based on JADE that has been recently proposed to ease the adoption of JADE, and to promote its use. In previous works, JADEL was specified at the syntax level, and only an informal semantics was given. The major contribution of this paper is to outline a formalization of the semantics of JADEL to complement previous works and to allow reasoning on JADEL agents and multi-agent systems. First, the paper provides a brief recall on JADEL by describing its main abstractions and their specific syntactic constructs. Then, a discussion of the proposed operational semantics based on transition systems is described. Finally, a detailed operational semantics of only some relevant constructs is given. The validity of the proposed approach is discussed in the conclusion of the paper, together with directions of future developments.

	Monica S.; Bergenti F.	An optimization-based algorithm for indoor localization of JADE agents	2017	This paper describes and evaluates an optimizationbased localization algorithm which has been recently implemented to enrich the possibilities of the localization add-on module for JADE. The described algorithm targets indoor scenarios and it enables localization of JADE agents running on smart devices in known environments, provided that a conventional WiFi network is present. The algorithm assumes that WiFi access points in fixed and known positions are available, and it estimates the position of the smart device where the agent is running using estimates of the distance between the smart device and each access point. Distance estimates are used to build an optimization problem, whose solution is an estimate of the position of the smart device. The described algorithm uses particle swarm optimization to solve the built optimization problem, but it is open to the adoption of other optimization techniques. The validity of the proposed approach is supported by experimental results shown in the last part of the paper.
	Longo F.; Santoro C.	A python-based assistant agent able to interact with natural language	2018	This paper describes the software architecture and functionalities of an assistant agent, developed by the authors, able to interact with the user through the natural language. The agent is implemented by means of PROFETA, a Python-based BDI engine developed within the author's research group. The agent is composed of two parts: (i) the speech-to-text and text-to-speech services, and (ii) the reasoning engine. As for the former part, the agent exploits Could services (in particular those provided by Microsoft Bing and IBM Watson); to this aim, a flexible software architecture is designed in order to connect first-class entities of PROFETA (i.e. sensors and actions) to the cloud world. The reasoning engine is instead designed by means of the declarative language provided by PROFETA: utterances said by the user become PROFETA beliefs that can, in turn, trigger reasoning rules. In order to show effectiveness of the solution, a case-study of speech-based interaction to browse Wikipedia is presented. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.

Towards smart factory: Multi-agent integration on industrial standards for service-oriented communication and semantic data exchange	2018	The concept of smart factories in the industry 4.0 (I40) paradigm is based on the concept of cyberphysical systems which is more specifically elaborated within the concept of the smart manufacturing component. In that concept an arbitrary production asset is assigned to an administration shell, that covers partial models and services for arbitrary functions. The desired attributes of smart factories to be self-organized, self-optimized, self-learning, etc. is based on the idea of an intelligent cooperation between the smart manufacturing components. However, the actual performing of this co-operation is not appropriately elaborated yet. In this paper the approach of a Multi-Agent-System to be applied as a well elaborated mean for intelligent co-operation of smart manufacturing components shall overcome this lack. Furthermore the application of existing standards for service-oriented industrial communication infrastructure by OPC-UA and for semantic data exchange by AutomationML provides existing means for realizing the required connectivity and interoperability for intelligent co-operation that shall realize self-X capabilities of smart factories. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.

Effective group formation in agent societies	2018	In this paper we address the problem of measuring the overall effectiveness of group formation in virtual communities. Group formation is often driven by the combination of similarity and trust measures which are usually exploited with the recommendations provided by all the community members (global reputation). In this work propose a specific index to measure the effectiveness of group formation, and to exploit the local reputation in place of the global one. The use of local reputation will allow group administrators to save a significant amount of computationally and/or communicational tasks. We designed an algorithm to form effective groups in virtual communities and tested it on real data. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.

An agent framework to support air passengers in departure terminals	2018	Airports are complex nodes performing several roles such as interchange terminal, shopping and relaxing center, meeting area for short-time business activities. Airport operators pay great attention to financial profits from their managed assets, while passengers desire spending their slack time inside the terminal in a pleasant way after wasting time in queues and controls to access the gate areas. In such a context, an agent framework is proposed to support travelers' slack time by providing purchase suggestions potentially interesting for them. Recommendations are computed by taking into account passengers' interests, their current position inside the departure terminal and the commercial opportunities available therein. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.

Overview of a scripting language for JADE - Based multi-agent systems	2018	This paper outlines the major features of Jadescript, a scripting language designed to support agent-oriented programming. The core abstractions that Jadescript provides are those related to event-driven agents and message passing, and the view of multi-agent systems that it promotes is closely related to that offered by JADE.

	Falcone R.; Sapienza A.	Institutional alarmism and the damage it provokes in case of hydrogeological disasters: A simulative estimation	2018	It is common practice for local authorities to create weather alerts even when there is no need, in order to protect themselves legally. However, this has a strong negative effect on the population, involving in a first phase fear and alarmism, and subsequently a drastic decrease of trust in the authority and therefore in what it reports. The catastrophic result is that in the long-term periods the alert itself loses its value, so the population will not respond effectively when it is time to do so. The purpose of this work is to provide an idea of the possible damage caused by this practice. Therefore, we realized a simulative scenario, in which a population faces a series of events over time, with the risk of a critical one, while the authority decides whether to communicate its forecast as it is or to overestimate it. Trust acts as glue in the close relationship between authorities and citizens, and then we start analyzing it and then showing how its decrease, due to the alarmism, increases the damage that the population suffers, providing also a quantitative evaluation. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.

Re-engineering IoT systems through ACOSO-Meth: The IETF CoRE based agent framework case study	2018	The Agent-based Cooperating Smart Objects methodology (ACOSO-Meth) fully supports the systematic development of Internet of Things (IoT) systems from analysis to implementation by tackling their manifold requirements (e.g., self-management, distributed smartness, interoperability). At the same time, ACOSO-Meth allows the re-engineering of existing IoT systems, thus enhancing their maintainability, reusability and extensibility. In such direction, this paper (i) first presents the integration of the resource-oriented agent framework complying with the IETF Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE) framework into ACOSO-Meth; then (ii) reports a case study to exemplify the re-engineering of a resource-constrained agent application through the ACOSO-Meth metamodel-driven approach. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.

Self-adaptive reconfigurations of Shipboard Power Systems	2018	The Shipboard Power System (SPS) is the element of a ship that is responsible for supplying energy to vessel operations. This component is critical to the survival and safety of the ship because many accidents may occur during ship navigation are often due to electrical failures. The SPS manages the electrical topology to successfully supply energy to the several onboard components. The proposed reconfiguration architecture uses a distributed and mission-oriented approach based on a generic-purpose self-adaptive middleware (MUSA). This paper illustrates how MUSA has been customized to dynamically reconfigure the electrical circuit of a vessel. In case of failures or unexpected events, it generates at run-time several possible solutions that properly considers ship's mission and the current scenario. The solution also includes a Matlab/Simulink simulator to validate the solution. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.
	Briola D.; Mascardi V.; Gioseffi M.	OntologyBeanGenerator 5.0: Extending ontology concepts with methods and exceptions	2018	When modeling and implementing complex systems based on agents and artifacts, achieving semantic interoperability is not only useful, but often necessary. A commonly adopted solution to manage complex and real MASs is adopting a Model Driven methodology, which uses an ontology as the formal representation of the domain, and then exploiting some existing tool to automatically generate code for agents in the MAS, to let them interact according to the model. While this approach is satisfactorily supported when the target MAS environment is Jason, less support is provided to Jade MASs, despite Jade's large adoption for real MASs development. So, considering the great support given by the automatic code generation starting from a formal model, and the large community working on Jade MASs, in this work we present an extension of the OntologyBeanGenerator plugin for Protégé, used to generate a Java representation of an OWL ontology for Jade. We improved the OntologyBeanGenerator tool to support the modeling of exceptions, formalized at the ontology level, and of methods associated with ontology elements, to set the interface of concrete objects (artifacts) at design stage. This extension allows us to integrate in a Model Driven approach a support for the formal definition of artifacts and provide an automatic generation of Jade code/interfaces to interact with them respecting the model. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.
	Cossentino M.; Lopes S.; Nuzzo A.; Renda G.; Sabatucci L.	A comparison of the basic principles and behavioural aspects of Akka, Jacamo and Jade development frameworks	2018	Akka, JaCaMo, and Jade are three Java-based frameworks for agent/actor system programming. They present substantial differences both in the reference models and the behavioural aspects of the main entities (actors vs agents). The objective of this work is to compare the basic principles and behavioural aspects of these three frameworks, also giving an overview of other comparison categories in which we briefly discuss other criteria like reasoning and knowledge, interaction/communication model, sociality. In each sub-category, the characteristics of the three frameworks will be analysed, and finally, the relative differences will be discussed. The analysis highlights a substantial difference between Akka actor-based system and agent-based ones, such as JaCaMo and Jade. The results of the analysis reveal that each framework has some competitive advantages over the others. In particular, the orientation to the reasoning and the pro-activity of the agents, the presence of native tools for communication and ontology and the predisposition to the widespread deployment of the code require a careful analysis of the software requirements for the choice of the most suitable framework. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.
	Ancona D.; Ferrando A.; Mascardi V.	Agents interoperability via conformance modulo mapping	2018	We present an algorithm for establishing a flexible conformance relation between two local agent interaction protocols (LAIPs) based on mappings involving agents and messages, respectively. Conformance is in fact computed "modulo mapping": two LAIPs τ and τ may involve different agents and use different syntax for messages, but may still be found to be conformant provided that a given map from entities appearing in τ to corresponding entities in τ is applied. LAIPs are modelled as trace expressions whose high expressive power allows for the design of protocols that could not be specified using finite state automata or equivalent formalisms. This expressive power makes the problem of stating if τ conforms to τ undecidable. We cope with this problem by over-approximating trace expressions that may lead to infinite computations, obtaining a sound but not complete implementation of the proposed conformance check. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.
	Sarné G.M.L.	A reputation agent model for reliable vehicle-to-vehicle information	2018	In the next future, an incredible amount of objects will be mutually interconnected to exchange information and services to realize more and more complex tasks. Unfortunately, this process places significant risks on the interconnected objects and their users, due to the adoption of unreliable information sources. Consequently, an emerging issue is of improving this aspect. In open and dynamic software agent contexts, this is a relevant question given the agents capability to quickly evaluate the potential effects of a greatest number of malicious behaviors in automated way. The adoption of authentication techniques is unable to assure the reliability of the information sources, differently from trust and reputation systems that fit well with such problems. The reliability of the information sources is becoming relevant also in the context of urban mobility where vehicles could acquire information coming not only from the infrastructures but also from other vehicles. Reliable information sources are fundamental to contribute in reducing the negative traffic effects in urban centers, which is among the most important factors affecting citizens' life quality. In the above scenario, we designed a distributed reputation model, working within an agent framework, to assure the reliability of the information sources in vehicle-to-vehicle interactions. In particular, the designed reputation model is able to detect malicious and cheating information sources as shown by some preliminary simulations carried out on a simple urban test network. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.

From the blockchain to logic programming and back: Research perspectives	2018	The blockchain is a novel approach to support distributed systems enabling a common, consistent view of a shared state among distributed nodes. There, smart contracts are computer programs that allow users to deploy arbitrary computations, in charge of automatically regulate state transitions and enforce properties. In this paper we speculate on how the blockchain and smart contracts could take advantage of a logic programming approach, and, complementarily, on how logic programming can benefit from the blockchain infrastructure.

A framework for personalized and adaptive socially assistive robotics	2018	Assistive technology is playing a crucial role in supporting caregivers and patients with neurological disorders to carry out home care services. Nevertheless, the technological advances allowing for the automation of such services often lead to systems composed of several devices that make patients not always comfortable when interacting with them, so limiting their effective use. In order to improve the acceptance level of an assistive system, a robotic system is proposed to act as a smart sensor whose functionalities to control its behavior as well as to provide meaningful observations from the input data are modeled as services. The system is supported by a middleware able to automatically schedule a set of home care services that are personalized for each patient considering the personal daily routine, the cognitive status, and the personality profile. In addition, the proposed system is able to react to dynamic changes in the patient's state by modifying the robot behavior and adapting on the fly the set of proposed home care services. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.
	D'Urso F.; Santoro C.; Santoro F.F.	Integrating heterogeneous tools for physical simulation of multi-unmanned aerial vehicles	2018	This paper presents a multi-layer software architecture to simulate, in a accurate and realistic way, a set of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in a specific mission. A set of tools are employed, each one to simulate a specific part of the overall UAV hardware and software structure: a 3D visualization engine, a physical simulator, the flight stack and a network simulator to handle interactions among UAVs. A software architecture able to orchestrate and coordinate such tools is proposed, based on multiple layers of processes divided into two categories. The described approach is based on a protocol system for exchanging messages to synchronize the various simulation tools. The simulation of the unmanned aerial vehicles can therefore be performed on a single machine or distributed on several machines in order to create a distributed simulation and spread the workload. In this way, it is possible to simulate the behavior of the UAVs and also to reason about the problems due to network communications. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.
	Crociani L.; Vizzari G.; Bandini S.	Between avoidance and imitation: Plausible wayfinding in pedestrian agent-based models	2018	Extending the range of pedestrian decision making activities represented in a simulation model represents a serious challenge: different decisions are taken at distinct levels of abstraction, employing different types of information and knowledge about the environment, from path planning to the regulation of distance from other pedestrians and obstacles present in the environment. Pedestrians, moreover, are not robots: although empirical observations show that they consider congestion when planning, there are evidences that their decisions are not always optimal (even in normal situations). We present a model integrating and improving consolidated results mitigating the optimization effects of congestion aware path planning by making commonsense estimations of the effects of perceivable congestion, also embedding an imitation mechanism stimulating changes in planned decisions whenever another nearby pedestrian did the same. The model is formally described and experimented both in a validation scenario as well as in a real-world situation: an interesting counterintuitive result, in which reducing available choices and exits actually reduces overall egress time, is also presented and discussed. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.

Semantic-based social intelligence through multi-agent systems	2018	Current technologies and market solutions are far from fulfilling the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) vision of simplified people-environment interactions. Even though Despite recent solutions based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies provide the needed infrastructure, most approaches suffer from inadequate levels of intelligence and autonomy. This paper proposes a novel semantic-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework complying with the emerging Social Internet of Things paradigm devoted to improve both automation and adaptivity: device agents self-organize in social relationships, interacting autonomously and sharing information, cooperating and orchestrating ambient resources. A service-oriented architecture allows collaborative dissemination, discovery and composition of service/resource descriptions. Decision and choreography capabilities of software agents leverage Semantic Web languages at the knowledge representation layer and a mobile-oriented implementation of non-standard inferences for semantic matchmaking. Benefits of the proposal are highlighted through an AmI case study in the field of Home and Building Automation (HBA). A comparison with the state of the art is also provided. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.

Logic programming in space-time: The case of situatedness in LPaaS	2018	Situatedness is a fundamental requirement for today's complex software systems, as well as for the computational models and programming languages used to build them. Spatial and temporal situatedness, in particular, are essential features for AI, enabling actors of the system to take autonomous decisions contextual to the space-time they live in. To support spatiotemporal awareness in distributed pervasive systems, we adopt the standpoint of Logic Programming (LP) by focussing on the Logic Programming as a Service (LPaaS) approach, promoting the distribution of situated intelligence. Accordingly, we provide an interpretation about what it means to make LP span across space and time, then we extend the LPaaS model and architecture towards spatio-temporal situatedness, by identifying a set of suitably-expressive spatio-temporal primitives. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.
	Comi A.; Fotia L.	Combining reliability, reputation and honesty to enhance QoS on federated computing infrastructures	2018	In this paper, we suggest an approach aimed at maximising the "global utility"(i.e., QoS) perceived into a large-scale federated computing infrastructures. Our approach computes the node and starts a procedure for the formation of coalitions between them. In particular, it is based on a trust model that allows actors to quantify the trustworthiness of their peers, and on a decentralised procedure that allows the Computing Federation to optimise the QoS. We define the generic SLA-based federated architecture, that is the global QoS offered by the federation, and we describe the theoretical foundation on which our proposal is based. Finally, we illustrate the experimental results which prove that the Global Capital of the Computing Federation improves. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.
	Bergenti F.; Monica S.	A kinetic model of the dynamics of compromise in large multi-agent systems	2018	Compromise is one of the primary phenomena that govern the dynamics of the opinion in multi-agent systems. In this paper, compromise is isolated from other phenomena, and it is studied using a statistical framework designed to investigate collective properties of large multi-agent systems. The proposed framework is completed with the details needed to model compromise, and differential problems which describe the dynamics of the opinion under suitable hypotheses are presented. Long-time asymptotic solutions of obtained differential problems are discussed to confirm that compromise makes multi-agent systems tend to reach consensus. It is proved that compromise makes all agents tend to share the same opinion, and that the value of the asymptotic opinion can be expressed in terms of the characteristics of the multi-agent system and of the initial distribution of the opinion. Obtained analytic results are confirmed by independent simulations in an illustrative case. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.
	Fotia L.	Recommending items in social networks using cliques-based trust	2018	Thematic groups are gaining a lot of attention and high centrality in online community, as users share opinions and/or mutually collaborate for reaching their targets. In this paper we consider the concept of clique in the social networks. A clique is a group of actors connected to each other more closely than the overall network of which they are a part. In the common language, the term clique means an informal and restricted social group formed by people who share common interests or characteristics. This paper proposes a new trust measure in social networks which focuses on cliques. In particular, we represent this scenario by means of a specific model, and we introduce an algorithm for detecting trust recommendations. We show a complete example of how our approach works. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.
1	Chella A.; Lanza F.; Seidita V.	Representing and developing knowledge using Jason, CArtAgO and OWL	2018	Contexts where agents and humans are required to collaborate and cooperate in a human-like fashion are complex systems where a high degree of self-adaptability of every component is demanding. A fundamental ingredient when developing and implementing this kind of systems is the knowledge representation. Knowledge of the goals, the environment, other agents' capabilities and task and of itself, is crucial in deciding which action to perform to reach an objective and to behave in a self-adaptive way. The problem of knowledge modeling and representation becomes more and more urgent if the agents' operation domain changes at runtime. Knowledge has to be updated and handled while the system is in execution. In this paper, we present a way for implementing a controlled semantic system to manage the belief base of a multi-agent system at runtime. Our work is based on the development of a specific approach for interfacing Jason, CArtAgO and Jena; the knowledge base representation employs OWL Ontology. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.
	Monica S.; Bergenti F.	Experiments on robust indoor localization of mobile devices using interval arithmetic	2019	The lack of techniques and tools to estimate the position of mobile devices with high accuracy and robustness is one of the major causes that limit the provision of advanced location-based services in indoor environments. An algorithm to enable mobile devices to estimate their positions in known indoor environments is discussed in this paper under the assumption that fixed network nodes are available at known locations. The discussed algorithm is designed to allow devices to estimate their positions by actively measuring the distances from visible fixed nodes. In order to reduce the errors introduced by the arrangement of the fixed nodes in the environment, the discussed algorithm transforms the localization problem into an optimization problem, which is then solved using interval arithmetic. Experimental results on the use of the discussed algorithm with distance estimates obtained using ultra-wide band are presented to assess the performance of the algorithm and to compare it with a reference alternative. Presented experimental results confirm that the discussed algorithm provides an increased level of robustness with respect to the considered reference alternative with no loss of accuracy. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

	Cavallaro C.; Verga G.; Tramontana E.; Muscato O.	Multi-agent architecture for point of interest detection and recommendation	2019	Geographical positions are widely employed in many applications, such as recommendation systems. The wide-spread use of mobile devices and location-based Internet services (e.g., Google Maps) gives the opportunity to collect user locations. Taking advantage of a multi-agent system, this work proposes an approach providing users with personalised recommendations of places of interests, such as libraries, museum, restaurants, etc. The approach offers a better experience by giving additional dynamic data (e.g. popularity, as number of users) to a list of Points Of Interest (POIs), and by exploring their temporal relations. Indeed, for POIs, which we determine using a DBSCAN algorithm, we take into account the time slots when the users visited them, to offer a more advanced service. Finally, the approach was designed to preserve the privacy of users, i.e. it does not reveal the position of users. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

	Sapienza A.; Falcone R.	A theoretical model for the human-IoT systems interaction	2019	Thanks to the IoT, our life will strongly improve in the next future. However, it is not given that the users will be able to afford all the automation it will offer or that it will be compatible with the users’ cognitive attitudes and its actual and real goals. In this paper, we face the question of the IoT from the user point of view. We start analyzing which reasons undermine the acceptance of IoT systems and then we propose a possible solution. The first contribution of this work is the level characterization of the autonomy a user can grant to an IoT device. The second contribution is a theoretical model to deal with users and to stimulate users’ acceptance. By the means of simulation, we show how the model works and we prove that it leads the system to an optimal solution. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.
	Cantucci F.; Falcone R.	A computational model for cognitive human-robot interaction: An approach based on theory of delegation	2019	In this paper we present a cognitive model to support reasoning and decision making on socially adaptive task delegation and adoption. The designed model allows a robot to dynamically modulate to dynamically modulate its own level of collaborative autonomy, by restricting or expanding a received task delegation, on the basis of several context factors as the needs of other users involved in the interaction. We exploit principles underlying theory of delegation, theory of mind and BDI agent modelling, in order to build a decision making system for real-world teaming between autonomous agents. The model has been developed by using JaCaMo framework, which provides support for implementing multi-agent systems and integrates different multi-agent programming dimensions. We tested our model in a specific domain on the humanoid robot Nao, widely adopted in human-robot interaction applications. The support study has established that the model provides the robot with the ability to modify its social autonomy and to handle possible collaborative conflicts due to the initiative to help the user beyond her/his request. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

	Postorino M.N.; Sarné G.M.L.	A preliminary study for an agent blockchain-based framework supporting dynamic car-pooling	2019	In the last decades, private cars caused an increasing growth of urban traffic flows all over the world with a consequent increase of environmental pollution and road congestion. In this context, Car-Pooling is an alternative car-based solution for private mobility that optimizes the car loading factor with respect to the number of passengers, although it requires that all the participants share trip origin and destination at the same time. To make the system more appealing, an on-demand service adopting variable fares on the basis of trip length and number of participants is proposed in this paper. Multi-agent, reputation and blockchain technologies are used and a suitable dynamic routing algorithm has been developed. Experiments on simulated data prove the potentiality of this approach. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

Towards the internet of safe and intelligent postal+ things	2019	SAFEPOST is an FP7 European project which was active from April 2012 to July 2016 aimed at the “reuse and development of Security Knowledge assets for International Postal supply chains”, as its full title explains. SAFEPOST addressed threats to postal security by designing and experimenting a sensor network detection system including gas, radiation, Raman spectroscopy and image-based sensors. In 2015, while SAFEPOST was running, the US Postal Service and IBM suggested the idea of applying sensors to the postal infrastructure components to bring the acquired data to the next supply chain level and optimize efficiency and costs, leading to an Internet of Postal Things. Merging the SAFEPOST and Internet of Postal Things approaches and applying the result of their merge to supply chains involving not only postal items, but also logistic infrastructures and business processes, paves the way to an Internet of Safe Postal+Things, IoSP+T. The IoSP+T can be further enriched and made smarter, more flexible, and intelligent, by adding agents below, inside, and on top of it. In this paper we provide our vision of the Internet of Safe and Intelligent Postal+ Things, IoSIP+T, highlighting challenges and opportunities. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

Towards a real-time BDI model for ROS 2	2019	In the race for automation, electronic devices are required to become more and more intelligent in order to make the correct choices in unforeseen situations without any need of human intervention. AI proposes basically two different approaches: machine learning algorithms and multi-agent systems. While the former perform very well when dealing with single, independent, computing units, multi-agent systems are more suitable in case of different components interacting with one another. In this paper, we propose a real-time multi-agent approach to improve practical reasoning, integrating the Belief-Desire-Intention model into one of the most popular robotics framework, ROS 2. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

	Mastroeni L.; Naldi M.; Vellucci P.	An agent-based model on scale-free networks for personal finance decisions	2019	Personal finance decisions emerge from a complex network of human connections, where the nodes or agents — banks, investors, financial advisors — take their choices on the basis of a variety of factors. All these agents form a society, which we modeled as an Agent-Based Model (ABM) on a scale-free network. In this paper, we will consider: honest agents, regular agents, insincere agents, stubborn agents and skilled (or unskilled) agents. Honest agents report truthfully their opinion while insincere agents state an opinion which is different from their internal belief. Regular agents are characterized by the same propensity to listen, contrary to what stubborn agents do because these agents evaluate the counterpart’s opinion but never approaches to it. Skilled and unskilled agents are the result of influence of the competence in the evolution of decisions in multi-agent systems. We perform a social simulation to show that, in particular, consensus, polarization, extremism or the emergence of a disordered regime are possible outcomes, even without explicit introduction of stubborn agents. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

	Fortino G.; Fotia L.; Messina F.; Rosaci D.; Sarné G.M.L.	Supporting agent CoT groups formation by trust	2019	IoT devices dealing with complex tasks require powerful hardware capabilities or to get resources on the cloud. When an IoT device is “virtualized” on the Cloud, it can rely on one or more software agent that can exploit its social attitude to interact and cooperate. In this context, the choice of a partner to cooperate is a sensitive question but when an agent cannot perform a reliable choice then, like real communities, it can ask information to other agents it considers as trustworthy. This process can be improved by partitioning the agents in groups by using trust relationships to allow agents to interact with the most reliable partners. To this aim, we designed an algorithm to form agent groups based on reliability and reputation information and the results of some simulations confirmed its potential advantages. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

Assessing usability of a robotic-based AAL system: A pilot study with dementia patients	2019	Ambient Assisted Living is playing a crucial role in supporting dementia patients to live in their preferred environment, so limiting the involvement of careers and/or relatives. In order for such systems to become a reality, patients need to feel comfortable when interacting with them, and so an agent-based modular approach is adopted to make it possible to personalize the provision of digital services for each specific patient’s needs. Here, we experiment with a robotic-based ambient assisted environment to analyze the perceived usability when real patients interact with it in a controlled research laboratory where the system is deployed, by taking into account both their personality traits and cognitive status. The perceived usability is evaluated through a survey with a set of patients filling a questionnaire specifically designed for the experimentation that is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use Technology (UTAUT). The preliminary obtained results show that the perceived usability of the system is related to some traits of patients’ personality, while their cognitive status impacts the provided assistive services. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

Endowing robots with self-modeling abilities for trustful human-robot interactions	2019	Robots involved in collaborative and cooperative tasks with humans cannot be programmed in all their functions. They are autonomous entities acting in a dynamic and often partially known environment. How to interact with the humans and the decision process are determined by the knowledge on the environment, on the other and on itself. Also, the level of trust that each member of the team places in the other is crucial to creating a fruitful collaborative relationship. We hypothesize that one of the main components of a trustful relationship resides in the self-modeling abilities of the robot. The paper illustrates how employing the model of trust by Falcone and Castelfranchi to include self-modeling skills in the NAO humanoid robot involved in trustworthy interactions. Self-modeling skills are then implemented employing features by the BDI paradigm. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

Towards an ontology-based framework for a behavior-oriented integration of the IoT	2019	We present a prototype version of an ontology-based framework, called PROF-ONTO, that integrates IoT devices and users with domotic environments. PROF-ONTO is based on a novel OWL 2 ontology, called OASIS (Ontology for Agents, Systems, and Integration of Services), modelling behaviors of agents such as IoT devices and users, and other information concerning user requests, their executions, restrictions and authorizations. User requests are performed by automatically selecting compatible devices: agents expose their behaviors and are invoked accordingly to what they are able to do on specific categories of components. OASIS is also used to build semantic knowledge bases that operate as transparent communication and information exchange systems among agents. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.
	Lombardo G.; Poggi A.	A scalable and distributed actor-based version of the Node2Vec algorithm	2019	The analysis of systems that can be modeled as networks of interacting entities is becoming often more important in different research fields. The application of machine learning algorithms, like prediction tasks over nodes and edges, requires a manually feature extraction or a learning task to extract them automatically (embedding techniques). Several approaches have been proposed in the last years and the most promising one is represented by the Node2Vec algorithm. However, common limitations of graph embedding techniques are related to memory requirements and to the time complexity. In this paper, we propose a scalable and distributed version of this algorithm called ActorNode2vec, developed on an actor-based architecture that allows to overcome these kind of constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with a real large network by analyzing the sensitivity of two algorithm’s parameters (walk length and number of walks) with a comparison with the original algorithm. Results shows an average reduction between the 65% and the 82% in terms of the required computational times. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

In this kind of socio-technical context, it is possible to create distributed applications for the administration of cities and neighborhood, using data provided directly by citizens. In particular, it is possible to connect users and integrate their actions into the whole system, thanks to wide available instant messaging apps, used by the greatest part of mobile users. The combined use of public APIs, Web systems and automated bots allowed us to build a comprehensive framework for managing the reports sent to the local government by citizens through their already installed and well-known instant messaging apps, such as Whatsapp, Telegram and Messenger. In this paper we show the techniques used for retrieving and classifying texts and images of the reports, for their management by the most appropriate branch of local administration.

Interpretable narrative explanation for ML predictors with LP: A case study for XAI	2019	In the era of digital revolution, individual lives are going to cross and interconnect ubiquitous online domains and offline reality based on smart technologies—discovering, storing, processing, learning, analysing, and predicting from huge amounts of environment-collected data. Sub-symbolic techniques, such as deep learning, play a key role there, yet they are often built as black boxes, which are not inspectable, interpretable, explainable. New research efforts towards explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are trying to address those issues, with the final purpose of building understandable, accountable, and trustable AI systems—still, seemingly with a long way to go. Generally speaking, while we fully understand and appreciate the power of sub-symbolic approaches, we believe that symbolic approaches to machine intelligence, once properly combined with sub-symbolic ones, have a critical role to play in order to achieve key properties of XAI such as observability, interpretability, explainability, accountability, and trustability. In this paper we describe an example of integration of symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques. First, we sketch a general framework where symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches could fruitfully combine to produce intelligent behaviour in AI applications. Then, we focus in particular on the goal of building a narrative explanation for ML predictors: to this end, we exploit the logical knowledge obtained translating decision tree predictors into logical programs. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

	D’Asaro F.A.; Origlia A.; Rossi S.	Towards a logic-based approach for multi-modal fusion and decision making during motor rehabilitation sessions	2019	We introduce a general approach which aims at combining machine learning and logic-based techniques in order to model its user’s cognitive and motor abilities. In the context of motor rehabilitation, hybrid systems are a convenient option as they allow both for the representation of formal constraints needed to implement a clinically valid exercise, and for the statistical modelling of intrinsically noisy data sources. Moreover, logic-based systems offer a transparent way to look at the decisions taken by an automated system. This is particularly useful when an AI system needs to interact with a therapist in order to assist therapeutic intervention, e.g. by explaining why a given decision is sound. This methodology is currently being developed within the context of the AVATEA project. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

Application of Lovheim model for emotion detection in english tweets	2019	Emotions are central for a wide range of everyday human experiences and understanding emotions is a key problem both in the business world and in the fields of physiology and neuroscience. The most well-known theory of emotions proposes a categorical system of emotion classification, where emotions are classified as discrete entities, while psychologists say that in general man will hardly express a single basic emotion. According to this observation, alternative models have been developed, which define multiple dimensions corresponding to various parameters and specify emotions along those dimensions. Recently, one of the most used models in affective computing is the Lovheim’s cube of emotions, i.e., a theoretical model that focuses on the interactions of monoamine neurotransmitters and emotions. This work presents a comparison between a single automatic classifier able to recognize the basic emotions proposed in the Lovheim’s cube and a set of independent binary classifiers, each one able to recognize a single dimension of the Lovehim’s cube. The application of this model has determined a notable improvement of results: in fact, in the best case there is an increment of the accuracy of 11,8%. The set of classifiers has been modeled and deployed on the distributed ActoDeS application architecture. This implementation improves the computational performance and it eases the system reconfiguration and its ability to recognize particular situations, consisting of particular combinations of basic emotions. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

	Petrosino G.; Bergenti F.	Extending message handlers with pattern matching in the jadescript programming language	2019	Software agents are characterized by sophisticated messaging capabilities that support distributed problem solving and that provide the basic ingredients for interoperability in open agent-based systems. Jadescript is an agent-oriented programming language that has been recently proposed to offer programmers the abstractions that characterize agents to concretely and effectively support the implementation of complex agent-based systems. As expected, the abstractions that Jadescript provides include native support for the advanced messaging capabilities that characterize agents. This paper describes a recent development of Jadescript that extends the language with a native support for pattern matching designed to simplify the reception of structured messages and to ease the management of complex conversations. The proposed support for pattern matching is intimately correlated with the type system of the language, and it can be used to effectively associate inbound messages with specific handlers. From the point of view of programmers, the proposed support for pattern matching allows clearly expressing the intended scope of message handlers, and it contributes to raise the level of abstraction of the language. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

	Bicocchi N.; Cabri G.; Leonardi L.; Salierno G.	Intelligent agents supporting digital factories	2019	Intelligent agents represent a widely exploited paradigm of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI). They have been applied in many fields, and recently they have appeared also in the digital factory field. Digital factories are abstractions of real factories, which enable high-level management of factories’ processes, along with their automatization. So, the real factories can dynamically adapt their processes to unexpected situations. In this paper, we survey different works at the state of the art that show how intelligent agents can support digital factories, along with the limitations of their application. A discussion about the advantages of intelligent agents and the open issues completes the paper. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.
	Calegari R.; Omicini A.; Sartor G.	Computable law as argumentation-based MAS	2020	In this paper we sketch a vision of computable law as argumentation-based MAS, i.e., human-centred intelligent systems densely populated by agents (software or human) capable of understanding, arguing, and reporting, via factual assertions and arguments, about what is happening and what they can make possibly happen. A multi-agent system based on argumentation, dialogue, and conversation is, in this vision, the basis for making the law computable: through argumentation, dialogue, and adherence to social judgment, the behaviour of the intelligent system can be reached, shaped, and controlled with respect to the law. In such a scenario, computable law – and related intelligent behaviour – is likely to become associated with the capability of arguing about state and situation, by reaching a consensus on what is happening around and what is needed, and by triggering and orchestrating proper decentralised semantic conversations to decide how to collectively act in order to reach a future desirable state. Interpretability and explainability become important features for that sort of systems, based on the integration of logic-based and sub-symbolic techniques. Within this novel setting, MAS methodologies and technologies become the starting point to achieve computable law, even if they need to be adapted and extended for dealing with new challenges. Accordingly, in this paper we discuss how this novel vision can build upon some readily-available technologies, and the research challenges it poses. We analyse a number of approaches and technologies that should be involved in the engineering of systems and services, and become core expertise for distributed systems engineers. Among the others, these include knowledge representation, machine learning, and logic argumentation. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Transcultural health-aware guides for the elderly	2020	In this brief position paper, we present our vision for using software agents and related technologies to address the growing need of transcultural health-aware “Guides” for the elderly, an increasingly important topic given the clear trend of population ageing. Such autonomous intelligent guides are employed in smart living/city infrastructures to give emotional and healthcare support for the elderly wherever they are, whether at home, outdoors, or in hospital. The main purpose is to help ageing people to avoid progressive loss of physical, cognitive, and emotional activity, and most importantly to avoid social exclusion. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
	Mastroeni L.; Naldi M.; Vellucci P.	Calibration of an agent-based model for opinion formation through a retweet social network	2020	Calibration of agent-based models (ABM) for opinion formation is needed to set their parameters and allow their employment in the real world. In this paper, we propose to use the correspondence between the agent-based model and the social network where those agents express their opinions, namely Twitter. We propose a calibration method that uses the frequency of retweets as a measure of influence and allows to obtain the influence coefficients in the ABM by direct inspection of the weighted adjacency matrix of the social network graph. The method has a fairly general applicability to linear ABMs. We report a sample application to a Twitter dataset where opinions about wind power (where turbines convert the kinetic energy of wind into mechanical or electrical energy) are voiced. Most influence coefficients (76%) result to be zero, and very few agents (less than 5%) exert a strong influence on other agents. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
	Lombardo G.; Poggi A.	A preliminary experimentation for large scale epidemic forecasting simulations	2020	Agent-based modeling and simulation are some powerful techniques that are widely used with success for analyzing complex and emergent phenomena in many research and application areas. Many different reasons are behind the success of such techniques, among which an important mention goes to the availability of a great variety of software tools, that ease the development of models, as well as the execution of simulations and the analysis of results. This paper presents an actor software library, called ActoDeS, for the development of concurrent and distributed systems, and shows how it can be a suitable mean for building flexible and scalable epidemic forecasting simulations. In particular, the paper presents the first results of the experimentation of ActoDeS for defining a COVID-19 epidemic diffusion model and for supporting the simulation in large populations. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Reinforcement learning for autonomous agents exploring environments: An experimental framework and preliminary results	2020	Reinforcement Learning (RL) is being growingly investigated as an approach to achieve autonomous agents, where the term autonomous has a stronger acceptation than the current most widespread one. On a more pragmatic level, recent developments and results in the RL area suggest that this approach might even be a promising alternative to current agent-based approaches to the modeling of complex systems. This work presents an investigation of the level of readiness of a state-of-the-art model to tackle issues of orientation and exploration of a randomly generated environment, as a toy problem to evaluate the adequacy of the RL approach to provide support to modelers in the area of complex systems simulation, and in particular pedestrian and crowd simulation.

	Ciatto G.; Calegari R.; Siboni E.; Denti E.; Omicini A.	2P-Kt: Logic programming with objects & functions in Kotlin	2020	Mainstream programming languages nowadays tends to be more and more multi-paradigm ones, by integrating diverse programming paradigms—e.g., object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP). Logic-programming (LP) is a successful paradigm that has contributed to many relevant results in the areas of symbolic AI and multi-agent systems, among the others. Whereas Prolog, the most successful LP language, is typically integrated with mainstream languages via foreign language interfaces, in this paper we propose an alternative approach based on the notion of domain-specific language (DSL), which makes LP available to OOP programmers straightforwardly within their OO language of choice. In particular, we present a Kotlin DSL for Prolog, showing how the Kotlin multi-paradigm (OOP+FP) language can be enriched with LP in a straightforward and effective way. Since it is based on the interoperable 2P-Kt project, our technique also enables the creation of similar DSL on top of other high-level languages such as Scala or JavaScript—thus paving the way towards a more general adoption of LP in general-purpose programming environments. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

An agent-based simulator for urban air mobility scenarios	2020	In the next years, flying cars are expected to become a real opportunity to realize Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems. Most of the appeal is given by the opportunity of avoiding congestion, gaining time and reducing environmental impacts with respect to conventional mobility. However, UAM implementation is not trivial as it has several implications in manifold areas like safety, security, traffic control, legal issues and urban design among the others. To investigate on the impacts of UAM, a dedicated agent-based framework has been designed. The results of some preliminary tests carried out to verify the capabilities of this simulator are presented. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
	Yazdanpanah V.; Yazan D.M.; Zijm W.H.M.	A multiagent framework for coordinating industrial symbiotic networks	2020	We present a formal multiagent framework for coordinating a class of collaborative industrial practices called “Industrial Symbiotic Networks (ISNs)” as cooperative games. The game-theoretic formulation of ISNs enables systematic reasoning about what we call the ISN implementation problem. Specifically, the characteristics of ISNs may lead to the inapplicability of standard fair and stable benefit allocation methods. Inspired by realistic ISN scenarios and following the literature on normative multiagent systems, we consider regulations and normative socio-economic policies as coordination instruments that in combination with ISN games resolve the situation. In this multiagent system, employing Marginal Contribution Nets (MC-Nets) as rule-based cooperative game representations foster the combination of regulations and ISN games with no loss in expressiveness. We develop algorithmic methods for generating regulations that ensure the implementability of ISNs and as a policy support, present the policy requirements that guarantee the implementability of desired ISNs in a balanced-budget way. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
	de Meo P.; Falcone R.; Sapienza A.	Applying inferential processes to partner selection in large agents communities	2020	The current literature clearly highlighted the need to define a fast and efficient tool for trust assessment, even in lack of direct information, as much as possessing mechanisms allowing a matching between a selected task and a reliable agent able to carry it out. Direct experience plays a big part, yet it requires a long time to offer a stable and accurate performance and this characteristics may represents a strong drawback especially within huge agents’ communities. We support the idea that category-based evaluations and inferential processes represent a useful resource for trust assessment. Within this work, we exploit simulations to investigate how efficient this inferential strategy is, with respect to direct experience, focusing on when and to what extent the first prevails on the latter. Our results suggest that in some situations categories represent a valuable asset, providing even better results. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Suggesting just enough (un)crowded routes and destinations	2020	Though people like to visit popular places, for health-related concerns and due to the recent restrictions adopted around the world, gatherings should be avoided. When planning a trip, one has to consider both attractiveness in terms of general interest for the destinations, and the density of people gathering there. In this work, we propose a recommendation system aiming at offering users some suggestions on useful routes and destinations that balance both liveliness and overcrowding. Firstly, we use datasets storing GPS positions as a basis for the statistics on routes and destinations. Then, we use an accurate probability algorithm that estimates the number of people moving from one place to another in the city and accordingly we show a list of destinations to users. The destination points are filtered based on the user’s preference on the density of people. A multi-agent system is used to handle the user requests to find a route for a trip, statistics on possible destinations, and suggestions to users. Thanks to our solution we can inform users on suitable routes and destinations, as well as alert them when a preferred destination is overcrowded. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

A multi-agent system for simulating the spread of a contagious disease	2020	Recent events concerning global health risks have made truly evident the importance of advanced strategies and tools to monitor and prevent the spread of new and unpredictable diseases. COVID-19 showed the world that there are many factors that come into play when facing a viral threat, such as politics, social and economic aspects. Taking those into account when trying to deal with such events can make a huge difference in the efficacy and efficiency of the responses to the viruses. In this paper, we propose the use of a Multi-Agent system that extends the previous multi-agent-based approaches by adding a whole new set of features to control the outbreak during the simulation in order to dynamically verify how the government strategies can impact the disease spread. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Actor-based architecture for cloud services orchestration: The case of social media data extraction	2020	In this paper we present a distributed system for social media scraping which aims to acquire an arbitrarily large number of information from social networks, by exploiting an actor-based solution able to orchestrate efficiently several services on cloud. Our goal is to ensure that correct operations among actors occur, thanks to a master node, based on the ActoDeS architecture, which takes care of managing communications, interface and messages exchanged by client nodes. As a use case, we consider Twitter as social media platform for the key role that is playing in the modern society, as shown by Google Trends data. However, Twitter’s search API have many limitations and there is definitely no way to make it work when it comes to obtaining millions of records within a monthly or annual time range. Thus, we have designed a distributed solution that is able to overcome these constraints without breaking the current laws on this subject and the policies of Twitter. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

A tool for the automatic generation of MOISE organisations from BPMN	2020	Multi-agent systems proved successful in enacting business processes because of their inner properties (distribution of tasks, collaboration and coordination among agents). MAS adoption in enacting processes becomes even more interesting if they exhibit adaptation capabilities. The proposed approach consists in the automatic generation of a MOISE organisation from the BPMN specification of a business process. This organisation is conceived to support adaptation because of the possibility to adapt its configuration at runtime according to emerging needs. Here, we focus on the tool for processing BPMN specification and generating MOISE organization code. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

	Spina R.; Fornaia A.; Tramontana E.	An early warning system for seismic events based on the multi-agent model	2020	When a disastrous earthquake is about to occur in a specific territory, there are a series of anomalies that alter the pre-existing natural balances. Seismic swarms, ground deformation, bright flashes, emissions of various gas types (radon, CO2,..), changes in the composition and flow rate groundwater are just some physical-chemical perturbations induced by the growing stress condition borne by the crustal masses. Dilatancy theory and asperity model allow us to interpret the dynamic mechanisms to which the seismic precursors are due: the development of a network of cracks and the sliding of areas with less mechanical resistance are in agreement with seismic, mechanical and geochemical anomalies that occur before to high magnitude earthquakes. In areas with high seismic risk, constant monitoring of geophysical parameters is frequent, carried out using different types of sensors. The MAS (Multi-Agent System) model is one of the most suitable choices for efficiently implementing a seismic alert system, based on the interpretation of experimental data obtained from the sensor network. Using this type of approach, a Seismic Early Warning (SEW) has been created that according to the data acquired by the sensors and through the activities carried out by agent clusters, define the risk of seismic events having magnitude at least six. The SEW system aims to interpret, in real-time, the variations of an adequate number of seismic precursors for specific threshold values, calculated statistically. The integrated and complementary analysis of them, using several specific Boolean expressions, assesses the contribution provided by each parameter for computing the level of risk, divided into soft, medium and hard. The model has been tested with data gathered in New Zealand, a nation with a high seismic and volcanic risk which offers free access to some seismic precursors. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
	Bertolotti F.; Roman S.	Risk sensitivity of production studios on the us movie market: An agent-based simulation	2021	The movie industry is a highly product differentiated industry where firms mainly compete in non-price product attributes. The success of a movie on the film distribution market depends on a variety of factors. Because of the short life cycle, the rapid decay in revenues, and the constant entrance of new competitive products, temporal decisions play a crucial role. The time series of the number of movies on release and the sum of the box office results of the ten top movies (ranked by box office result for that week) show that a seasonality emerges in the US movie market. Moreover, the two time series are on counterphase. We suggest the reason is a risk sensitivity adaptation in the behaviour of the movie's distributors. This paper tests this hypothesis. We develop an agent-based model of a movie market, and we simulated it for 15 years. We show that a comparable global behaviour exists when producers schedule the movies according to given risk-sensitive strategies. Our analysis improves the knowledge of the US motion picture market and may support film producers on how to change their scheduling decisions. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.
	Cavallaro C.; Tramontana E.	User assistance for predicting the availability of bikes at bike stations	2021	Generally, assistant agents have been employed to recommend users some goods or services they could be interested in. Moreover, thanks to devices recording user geographical positions, recommendation systems have been developed to propose places to visit. This paper proposes an approach for making an estimate of bikes available at bike stations, hence facilitating the use of such a transport means. I.e. users made aware of bike availability beforehand can choose such a transport mode more easily. By using a fast algorithm analysing data recording all bike movements, we obtain an accurate estimate of where bikes will be in the near future. This is possible by determining the frequent paths of bikes, according to their starting points, and the likely destinations. Thanks to such estimates, users can be alerted beforehand about the desired bike at their preferred bike station. Then, a message will be sent when the bike is in the station. Assistant agents giving such alerts are provided to users as an app on their smartphone. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

Predicting humans: A sensor-based architecture for real time Intent Recognition using Problog	2021	In a world where the population is aging, products that improve living comfort will have more importance in people's lives. These products must interpret the intentions of those who live in the house to provide them with assistance in their daily tasks. Motivated by these issues, we present an architecture for real-time Intention Recognition. We demonstrate it with a kitchen use-case, where the agent prepares a meal. Our goal is to recognize what type of meal the agent intends to prepare. The architecture consists of two layers, namely the “Classification Layer” and the “Problog Layer”. The Classification Layer recognizes the environment through sensors and classifiers, and passes the information to the Problog Layer, which uses Problog to infer the intention. The Problog Layer consists of two Knowledge Bases: the “Static KB” and the “Dynamic KB”. The former axiomatically describes the intentions we want to recognize, while the latter is generated at runtime using information from the Classification Layer. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

A curriculum-based reinforcement learninig approach to pedestrian simulation	2021	Reinforcement Learning represents a way to train an agent situated in an environment what to do to maximise an accumulated numerical reward signal (received by the environment as a feedback to every chosen action). Within this paper we explore the possibility to apply this approach to pedestrian modelling: pedestrians generally do not exhibit an optimal behaviour, therefore we carefully defined a reward function (combining contributions related to proxemics, goal orientation, basic wayfinding considerations), but also a particular training curriculum, a set of scenarios of growing difficulty supporting the incremental acquisition of proper orientation, walking, and pedestrian interaction competences. The paper will describe the fundamental elements of the approach, its implementation within a software framework employing Unity and ML-Agents, describing the promising achieved simulation results. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

Graph neural networks as the copula mundi between logic and machine learning: A roadmap	2021	Combining machine learning (ML) and computational logic (CL) is hard, mostly because of the inherently-different ways they use to represent knowledge. In fact, while ML relies on fixed-size numeric representations leveraging on vectors, matrices, or tensors of real numbers, CL relies on logic terms and clauses-which are unlimited in size and structure. Graph neural networks (GNN) are a novelty in the ML world introduced for dealing with graph-structured data in a sub-symbolic way. In other words, GNN pave the way towards the application of ML to logic clauses and knowledge bases. However, there are several ways to encode logic knowledge into graphs: which is the best one heavily depends on the specific task at hand. Accordingly, in this paper, we (i) elicit a number of problems from the field of CL that may benefit from many graph-related problems where GNN has been proved effective; (ii) exemplify the application of GNN to logic theories via an end-to-end toy example, to demonstrate the many intricacies hidden behind the technique; (iii) discuss the possible future directions of the application of GNN to CL in general, pointing out opportunities and open issues. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

A trust model to form teams of agentified AGVs in workshop areas	2021	Smart Workshops are experiencing the need of a mobile intelligence for mining both learning patterns and knowledge from the wide sea of data generated by both mobile users and mobile technologies. Indeed, mobile intelligence would represent the ideal substratum for providing "agentified" robots with a plethora of advanced capabilities (e.g., visual recognition, fault detection, self-recovery) and, hence, with high-level functionalities, like production line control, asset movement, connectivity restore. Besides the operational plane, however, mobile intelligence can be successfully exploited also in organizational tasks, like the formation of temporary, ad-hoc teams for accomplishing a given target. The complexity of some industrial operations, indeed, often demands the involvement of several, heterogeneous group of robots and the adequate representation of the reciprocal trustworthiness represents a key pre-requisite. It holds particularly for the Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) which are increasingly involved in collaborative activities aimed to optimise storage, picking, and transport functions in a wide variety of workshop areas. Therefore, in this paper we define a trustworthiness model for agentified AGVs based on the mix of their reputation and reliability and we present an agent-based framework implementing the related team formation strategy. The improvements obtained in terms of effectiveness and efficiency from the AGV team are observed and measured through a simulation activity, in which realistic settings for an industrial applications have been considered. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

	Falcone R.; Sapienza A.	Information seeking behavior at the time of COVID-19	2021	Italy was the first European country to be affected by COVID-19, facing an unprecedented situation. The reaction required drastic solutions and highly restrictive measures, which severely tested the trust of the Italian people. In this context, the role of information sources was fundamental, since they strongly influence public opinion. The central focus of this research is to assess how the information seeking behavior (ISB) of the Italian citizens affected their perception of government response strategies during the pandemic. Starting from the result of a survey addressed to 4260 Italian citizens, we used social simulation to estimate the evolution of public opinion. Particular attention has been given to different social categories, identified by age and gender. Comparing the ISB during and before COVID-19, we discovered that the shift in the ISB, during the pandemic, may have actually positively influenced public opinion, facilitating the acceptance of the costly restrictions introduced. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

	Pigazzini I.; Briola D.; Fontana F.A.	Architectural technical debt of multiagent systems development platforms	2021	Technical debt is candidate to be the next buzzword in software engineering, and the number of studies evaluating the technical debt of software projects is increasing. A particular and dangerous type of debt is the architectural debt, i.e., the consequences of sub-optimal design decisions. Currently, there are no studies about the evaluation of architectural debt in MultiAgent Systems (MAS) and platforms. Hence, in this paper we propose the analysis of four well-known MAS development platforms, with the aim of evaluating their architectural debt and open the discussion in this field. We exploit a tool, named Arcan, developed for architectural smell detection and for the computation of an architectural debt index. The results show that MAS development platforms are subjected to architectural debt, and in particular to the presence of Cyclic Dependency smells. However, there is evidence that the minimum amount of debt is reached when developers report “bug fixes” and “Improvements”. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.
	Cossentino M.; Lopes S.; Sabatucci L.; Tripiciano M.	Towards a semantic layer for Italian emergency plans	2021	Emergency plans require a complex collaboration among multiple departments and roles. They are generally long textual documents containing practical instructions for hazard responses in natural language. This work focuses on converting informal documents to a more rigorous structured-text representation by taking advantage of well-known techniques from the literature. However, this task is costly, it requires technical skills and sound domain knowledge, and it is entirely subjective. To this aim, we propose a semantic layer that supports the formalization of an emergency plan by identifying essential elements of the input document and highlighting inconsistencies, redundancies, and ambiguities. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

	Sabbatini F.; Ciatto G.; Calegari R.; Omicini A.	On the design of PSyKE: A platform for symbolic knowledge extraction	2021	A common practice in modern explainable AI is to post-hoc explain black-box machine learning (ML) predictors - such as neural networks - by extracting symbolic knowledge out of them, in the form of either rule lists or decision trees. By acting as a surrogate model, the extracted knowledge aims at revealing the inner working of the black box, thus enabling its inspection, representation, and explanation. Various knowledge-extraction algorithms have been presented in the literature so far. Unfortunately, running implementations of most of them are currently either proof of concepts or unavailable. In any case, a unified, coherent software framework supporting them all - as well as their interchange, comparison, and exploitation in arbitrary ML workflows - is currently missing. Accordingly, in this paper we present PSyKE, a platform providing general-purpose support to symbolic knowledge extraction from different sorts of black-box predictors via many extraction algorithms. Notably, PSyKE targets symbolic knowledge in logic form, allowing the extraction of first-order logic clauses. The extracted knowledge is thus both machine- and human-interpretable, and can be used as a starting point for further symbolic processing-e.g. automated reasoning. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

	Cantucci F.; Falcone R.; Castelfranchi C.	Investigating adjustable social autonomy in human robot interaction	2021	More and more often, Human Robot Interaction(HRI) applications require the design of robotics systems whose decision process implies the capability to evaluate not only the physical environment, but especially the mental states and the features of its human interlocutor, in order to adapt their social autonomy every time humans require the robot's help. Robots will be really cooperative and effective when they will expose the capability to consider not only the goals or interests explicitly required by humans, but also those one that are not declared and to provide help that go beyond the literal task execution. In order to improve the quality of this kind of smart help, a robot has to operate a meta-evaluation of its own predictive skills to build a model of the interlocutor and of her/his goals. The robot's capability to self-trust its skills to interpret the interlocutor and the context, is a fundamental requirement for producing smart and effective decisions towards humans. In this work we propose a simulated experiment, designed with the goal to test a cognitive architecture for trustworthy human robot collaboration. The experiment has been designed in order to demonstrate how the robot's capability to learn its own level of self-trust on its predictive abilities in perceiving the user and building a model of her/him, allows it to establish a trustworthy collaboration and to maintain an high level of user's satisfaction, with respect to the robot's performance, also when these abilities progressively degrade. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

Embedding a neuro-fuzzy mode choice tool in intelligent agents	2021	Increasing road traffic levels in urban areas require actions and policies to manage and control the number of road users. Travelers' choices of transport modes, particularly private cars, that generate the main share of road traffic levels, depend on many factors, which include both personal preferences and level-of-service variables. Understanding how travelers choose transport modes according to the above factors is an important challenge in order to adopt the most suitable policies and facilitate a sustainable mobility. In the literature, behavioral models have been mainly proposed in order to both estimate mode choice percentages and capture travel behaviors by suitable estimation of some parameters associated to the above factors. However, behavior is complex in itself and the mechanisms underlying user behavior might be difficult to be captured by traditional models. In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy approach is proposed to extract mode choice decision rules by evaluating different sets of rules and different membership functions of the neuro-fuzzy model. Particularly, to determine which inputs are the most relevant in such decision process, fuzzy curves and surfaces have been considered in order to take into account nonlinear effects. The neuro-fuzzy model proposed in this paper has been thought to be embedded in an agent-based methodological framework where user agents - representing travelers - make travel choices based on the rules learnt by means of the neuro-fuzzy system. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

ActoDemic: A distributed framework for fine-grained spreading modeling and simulation in large scale scenarios	2021	Agent-based modeling and simulation techniques are widely and successfully used for analyzing complex and emergent phenomena in many research and application areas. Among the many different reasons which sustain the flexibility and success of such techniques, it is important to mention the availability of a great variety of software tools, easing (1) the development of models, (2) the execution of simulations, and (3) the analysis of results. Currently, with the rapid global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most important research area is dedicated to define algorithms and systems to support epidemic forecasting simulations, scalable on large populations. In particular, in this paper, we propose an agent-based epidemic model and a distributed architecture that can be used for the simulation of populations represented by millions of agents. Moreover, the paper presents the results of the simulations on the data of the population of Lombardy. © 2021 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.
	Cantucci F.; Falcone R.	Autonomous Critical Help provided by an Artificial Agent in the field of Cultural Heritage	2022	In this work we introduce a computational cognitive model that provide an intelligent agent (e.g. robot, virtual assistant) with the capability to personalize a museum visit. The personalization is based on the goals, interests of the user that intends to visit the museum and considers also the goals, interests of the museum curators that have designed the exhibition. We introduce and evaluate a special type of help provided by the agent, called Critical Help, that can lead to a change of the user’s request, with the goal to consider needs that the same user cannot or has not been able to assess. The computational model has been implemented by exploiting the well known agent oriented programming framework Jason. We recruited 26 real participants in a preliminary robotic experiment that we conducted in order to test the computational model. Each participant has interacted with the humanoid robot Nao, widely used in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The Ontology for Agents, Systems and Integration of Services: recent advancements of OASIS	2022	Semantic representation is, especially through the use of Semantic Web technologies, a key enabler for many application domains, notably thanks to the representation of agents. A semantic description of agents can be practically achieved by taking a behaviouristic approach, whose essential aim is to define the operational capabilities of every agent. These are leveraged to enable agents to operate and engage with their peers. The OASIS ontology — An Ontology for Agent, Systems, and Integration of Services, presented in 2019 — pursues the behaviouristic approach to deliver a higher-level, semantic representation system as well as a communication protocol for agents and their commitments. Following the profitable adoption of OASIS as a foundational ontology for agents in the context of blockchain-oriented e-commerce, the ontology has been maintained and substantially updated over the years. This paper reports on the modelling choices and general advancements since the first publication of OASIS, especially after its profitable adoption by an European project. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

	Agiollo A.; Rafanelli A.; Omicini A.	Towards Quality-of-Service Metrics for Symbolic Knowledge Injection	2022	The integration of symbolic knowledge and sub-symbolic predictors represents a recent popular trend in AI. Among the set of integration approaches, Symbolic Knowledge Injection (SKI) proposes the exploitation of human-intelligible knowledge to steer sub-symbolic models towards some desired behaviour. The vast majority of works in the field of SKI aim at increasing the predictive performance of the sub-symbolic model at hand and, therefore, measure SKI strength solely based on performance improvements. However, a variety of artefacts exist that affect this measure, mostly linked to the quality of the injected knowledge and the underlying predictor. Moreover, the use of injection techniques introduces the possibility of producing more efficient sub-symbolic models in terms of computations, energy, and data required. Therefore, novel and reliable Quality-of-Service (QoS) measures for SKI are clearly needed, aiming at robustly identifying the overall quality of an injection mechanism. Accordingly, in this work, we propose and mathematically model the first – up to our knowledge – set of QoS metrics for SKI, focusing on measuring injection robustness and efficiency gain. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Agent-based Spatial Model Coupling Using a Coordination Unit	2022	Modeling complex systems like soil functioning turns out to be a challenge due to its heterogeneous structure, the number of interactions and processes entangled with each other at various levels and scales. Its heterogeneous structure requires a spatially explicit account, by coupling models through the space by using its resources, as proposed by the spatial model coupling approaches. However, these approaches raise the problem of resource conflicts: interacting models can modify resources simultaneously while the amount available cannot supply models demands. As spatial model coupling approaches do not provide proper resource distribution methods to handle that matter, inconsistencies might occur if resource conflicts are poorly managed. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel coupling approach based on agent paradigm in which the space, associated with a coordination unit supports model exchange and conflict management. This architecture is illustrated by an UML Class Diagram that we implemented into the GAMA platform. To prove its effectiveness, we test the approach on a simple soil model in which numerous models compete for resources scattered in the space. Comparative results suggest that handling conflicts using the coordination unit shows more precise indications of resource use, compared to the model in which conflicts are mismanaged. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

	Sabbatini F.; Ciatto G.; Calegari R.; Omicini A.	Hypercube-Based Methods for Symbolic Knowledge Extraction: Towards a Unified Model	2022	Symbolic knowledge-extraction (SKE) algorithms proposed by the XAI community to obtain human-intelligible explanations for opaque machine learning predictors are currently being studied and developed with growing interest, also in order to achieve believability in interactions. However, choosing the most adequate extraction procedure amongst the many existing in the literature is becoming more and more challenging, as the amount of available methods increases. In fact, most of the proposed algorithms come with constraints over their applicability. In this paper we focus upon a quite general class of SKE techniques, namely hypercube-based methods. Despite being commonly considered as regression-specific, we discuss why hypercube-based SKE methods are flexible enough to deal with classification problems as well. More generally, we propose a common generalised model for hypercube-based methods, and we show how they can be exploited to perform SKE on datasets, predictors, or learning tasks of any sort. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The Evolution of Risk Sensitivity in a Sustainability Game: an Agent-based Model	2022	The research of a balance between the growing pressure of addressing long-term sustainability issues and the existence of short-term economic and political challenges is one of the main issues of this century. To contribute to this case, we design a four-players game to elicit this tension. Then, an agent-based model of this game is developed, to observe the effects and the effectiveness of various behaviours and strategies, especially regarding risk preferences. An evolutionary meta-model selects the best-performing agents during multiple generations, and data from the resulting population are collected.

Such games are two-player zero-sum reachability games between an Attacker and a Defender. This latter player can erase particular subsets of edges of the Attack Graph. To reason about such games we introduce a variant of Sabotage Modal Logic (that we call Subset Sabotage Modal Logic) in which one modality quantifies over non-empty subset of edges. We show that we can characterize the existence of winning Attacker strategies by formulas of Subset Sabotage Modal Logic. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

	Seidita V.; Lanza F.; Sabella A.M.P.; Chella A.	Can agents talk about what they are doing? A proposal with Jason and speech acts	2022	The dream of building robots and artificial agents that are more and more capable of thinking and acting like humans is growing by the day. Various models and architectures aim to mimic human behavior. In our current research, we propose a solution to make actions and thought cycles of agents explainable by introducing inner speech into a multi-agent system. The reasons that led us to use inner speech as a self-modeling engine raised the question of what inner speech is and how it affects cognitive systems. In this proposal, we used speech act to enable a coalition of agents to exhibit inner speech capabilities to explain their behavior, but also to guide and reinforce the creation of an inner model triggered by the decision-making process through actions applied to the surrounding world and to themselves. The BDI agent paradigm is used to keep the agents rational and with the innate ability to act in a human-like manner. The proposed solution continues the research path that began with the definition of a cognitive model and architecture for human-robot teaming interaction, and aims to integrate the believable interaction paradigm into it. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Emotional Behavior Trees for Empathetic Human-Automation Interaction	2022	For the tasks of improving caregiving in medicine and other sectors (i.e., teaching) and of constructing effective human-AI teams, agents should be endowed with an emotion recognition and management module, capable of empathy, and of modelling aspects of the Theory of Mind, in the sense of being able to reconstruct what what someone is thinking or feeling. In this paper, we propose an architecture for such a module, based upon an enhanced notion of Behavior Trees.

The role of decisional autonomy in User-IoT systems interaction	2022	As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to spread, emerging technologies provide devices with various autonomous capabilities that enable them to assist their users in a multitude of activities throughout their daily lives. Despite this, it is still unclear what the role of autonomy should be in this context, as limited academic research has been conducted on such a topic. This study tries to fill this research gap, by proposing a possible solution on how IoT devices may act in order to develop and regulate their autonomy, in relation to the specific user they interface with. After introducing a theoretical framework, we considered a possible implementation in a simulation context, showing how the proposed approach works. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Modeling Dynamic Web Polarization and Proximity Depolarization Processes by Compactness Measures	2022	In this paper, we deal with the possibility of simulating dynamic polarization and proximity depolarization processes in a software multi-agent community, modeling homophily and trust relationships usually present in human processes. Group polarization involves various disciplines, such as economics, social psychology, political science, sociology and many others, and it can be considered a critical process underlying relevant behaviors as, for instance, voting and conflictual intergroup relations in the society. Moreover, being a human social phenomenon, the polarization processes are subject to change over time or also effect overturning (i.e., depolarization). Our contribution consists of proposing a compactness-based model for equipping agents in order to simulate the complexity of such processes. We have simulated two case studies where polarization is ruled by compactness measures, combining similarity and trust with different percentages. We evaluated the results provided by compactness measures in order to verify the role of similarity and trust in the agent polarization processes. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

A view to a KILL: Knowledge Injection via Lambda Layer	2022	We propose KILL (Knowledge Injection via Lambda Layer) as a novel method for the injection of symbolic knowledge into neural networks (NN) allowing data scientists to control what the network should (not) learn. Unlike other similar approaches, our method does not (i) require ground input formulæ, (ii) impose any constraint on the NN undergoing injection, (iii) affect the loss function of the NN. Instead, it acts directly at the backpropagation level, by increasing penalty whenever the NN output is violating the injected knowledge. An experiment is reported to demonstrate the potential (and limits) of our approach. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Humans are not rational; artificial agents are not emotional	2022	Agents have been used as a unifying metaphor while designing socio-technical systems where humans interact with software components. As socio-technical systems have become consumer-oriented in areas such as health, it has been acknowledged that emotions need to be considered if people are to adopt technology.

	Lombardo G.; Pellegrino M.; Poggi A.	Unsupervised Continual Learning From Synthetic Data Generated with Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation: A preliminary experimentation	2022	Continual Learning enables to learn a variable number of tasks sequentially without forgetting knowledge obtained from the past. Catastrophic forgetting usually occurs in neural networks for their inability to learn different tasks in sequence since the performance on the previous tasks drops down in a significant way. One way to solve this problem is providing a subset of the previous examples to the model while learning a new task. In this paper we evaluate the continual learning performance of an unsupervised model for anomaly detection by generating synthetic data using an Agent-based modeling and simulation technique. We simulated the movement of different types of individuals in a building and evaluate their trajectories depending on their role. We collected training and test sets based on their trajectories. We included, in the test set, negative examples that contain wrong trajectories. We applied a replay-based continual learning to teach the model how to distinguish anomaly trajectories depending on the users’ roles. The results show that using ABMS synthetic data it is enough a small percentage of synthetic data replay to mitigate the Catastrophic Forgetting and to achieve a satisfactory accuracy on the final binary classification (anomalous / non-anomalous). © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

	Marcianò A.	Accurate Colluding Agents Detection by Reputation Measures	2022	Software agents can form multidimensional, relationship based networks potentially able to realize not trivial forms of interaction and cooperation among agents. In similar contexts, honest agents could be exposed to malicious behaviors acted by unqualified potential partners. Trust and Reputation Systems are effective tools able to mitigate such risks by providing the agent community with suitably information about the trustworthiness of the potential partners in order to allow a good partner choice. In such a framework, we propose: (i) a method to preliminarily identify the best promising candidates as malicious assigning them the role of pre-untrusted entities and (ii) a novel reputation model capable to accurately identify malicious agents without introducing collateral effects on the reputation scores of honest ones. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

1	Petrosino G.; Monica S.; Bergenti F.	Robust Software Agents with the Jadescript Programming Language	2022	This paper discusses several recent additions to the Jadescript agent-oriented programming language that regard the effective detection and handling of exceptional and erroneous situations at runtime. These new features were introduced to better support the mission-critical level of robustness that software agents are normally demanded to exhibit. The description of these new features is supported by an analysis of the state of the art of exception handling in programming languages, and it is complemented by a discussion on planned future developments. First, the novel exception handling mechanism introduced in Jadescript is presented, and the conceptual similarities and differences with the exception handling mechanisms normally provided by mainstream programming languages are emphasized. Second, the recent additions to Jadescript designed to support failures in behaviours are described, and these additions are related to the novel exception handling mechanism. Finally, the recent language support to manage stale messages using dedicated message handlers is presented and discussed. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

	Falcone R.; Sapienza A.	Dependence Networks and Trust in Agents Societies: Insights and Practical Implications	2023	In human, artificial, and hybrid societies, agents continuously interact to carry out complex tasks. In this sense, knowing and analyzing the dependencies that an agent has towards others (and vice versa) becomes a tool of fundamental importance. Making use of a structural theory, within this study, we investigate the role of dependence networks in the interaction between agents, with particular interest in the relationship between dependence and trust. The results of this research provide valuable insights into the use of dependence networks and how they influence collaboration and resource management. In particular, it is interesting to note that agents that exploit dependence, even when they have to interact with untrustworthy partners, obtain better performance in situations where resources are limited. On the contrary, in contexts where the use of dependency is limited, trust takes on a more relevant role. These conclusions emphasize the importance of dependence networks and their practical applications in areas such as robotics, resource management, and collaboration between humans and artificial agents. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

	Beretta D.; Monica S.; Bergenti F.	Capturing a Recursive Pattern in Neural-Symbolic Reinforcement Learning	2023	Neural-symbolic methods have gained considerable attention in recent years because they are valid approaches to obtain synergistic integration between deep reinforcement learning and symbolic reinforcement learning. Along these lines of research, this paper presents an extension to a recent neural-symbolic method for reinforcement learning. The original method, called State-Driven Neural Logic Reinforcement Learning, generates sets of candidate logic rules from the states of the environment, and it uses a differentiable architecture to select the best subsets of the generated rules that solve the considered training tasks. The proposed extension modifies the rule generation procedure of the original method to effectively capture a recursive pattern among the states of the environment. The experimental results presented in the last part of this paper provide empirical evidence that the proposed approach is beneficial to the learning process. Actually, the proposed extended method is able to tackle diverse tasks while ensuring good generalization capabilities, even in tasks that are problematic for the original method because they exhibit recursive patterns. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
	Marcianò A.; Rosaci D.; Sarnè G.M.L.	A Strategy to Detect Colluding Groups by Reputation Measures	2023	Collusion is the malicious activity mostly frequent in agent-based recommender systems in which two or more agents agree with each other to mutually exchange high positive feedback in order to gain undue advantages by altering the correct computation of reputation measures in their agent communities. Therefore, identification of colluding agents is an important issue and several strategies have been developed to this purpose. Among them, the EigenTrust algorithm is well known, although it is limited by the necessity of knowing a priori which agents are considered as trustworthy and the impossibility of recognizing several groups of colluding agents acting simultaneously and autonomously. The focus of this paper is dealing with the above issues and, to this end, we will present a strategy to support EigenTrust both providing the necessary inputs about pre-trusted agents and recognizing groups of malicious agents. In particular, we combined EigenTrust with a clustering process in order to suitably grouping the agents according to their reputation scores. We carried out a preliminary tests which have shown promising results about the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

	Seidita V.; Sabella A.M.P.; Chella A.	Agents Showing Self-Disclosure. A Preliminary Methodological Approach	2023	The interaction between humans and robots in Human-Robot Teaming Interaction (HRTI) necessitates robot autonomy, proactivity, and adaptability, as decisions are contingent upon the dynamic context. Trust plays a critical role, and the improvement of human trust and decision-making in robots or agents deployed within such contexts is augmented by robot explainability and self-disclosure. Self-disclosure refers to the ability of robots to effectively communicate pertinent information about themselves, while explainability pertains to the clear communication of robot actions. These concepts are closely interconnected and prove indispensable for effective human-robot interaction. In this paper, we propose a methodological approach for the development of HRTI systems with self-disclosure, leveraging BDI agent technology. The paper delineates how prior efforts in extending the BDI reasoning cycle have contributed to the identification of fundamental design abstractions for HRTI systems and associated agent design activities. This preliminary work underscores the significance of explainability and self-disclosure in human-robot collaboration within HRTI, presenting a pragmatic approach to developing HRTI systems endowed with self-disclosure capabilities through the utilization of BDI agent technology. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Curriculum–Based Reinforcement Learning for Pedestrian Simulation: Towards an Explainable Training Process	2023	Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a promising approach in the development of autonomous agents adopted in different contexts, from robotic control to virtual avatars in video games. The present contribution presents an application of DRL to the context of pedestrian simulation: building on previous results, we focus on wayfinding decisions, i.e. the decisions among different alternative trajectories within an annotated (planar) environment comprising rooms and passages, in which the agent might need to reach specific intermediate goals before moving towards a final exit. By employing a curriculum based approach, the learning process guides agents to develop a policy leading to the exploration of the environment to reach a set of intermediate waypoints and the final movement target, irrespectively of the specific map of the environment. We discuss the adopted approach, the achieved results, and we discuss potential steps towards improving the explainability of the training process by means of formalization of scenarios included in the curriculum, and their intended training goals. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Agents in Software Development Architectures	2023	Over the last few decades, information technologies in the field of computing systems and software architectures have evolved to provide companies with robust solutions to run their business logic. The transition from monolithic applications to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and micro-services represents a fundamental shift in the way companies design, build, and deploy their software. This evolution has been driven by the need for greater scalability, flexibility, and agility in response to the dynamic and demanding landscape of modern application requirements. As software development continues to evolve, the incorporation of intelligent agents has become widespread to provide smartness within distributed system as well as to design and manage complex scenarios, such as the device-edge-cloud continuum and IoT ecosystems. This paper explores the role of intelligent agents within SOA and micro-services architectures, highlighting the spectrum of benefits and limitations they bring to the development life cycle. We also discuss challenges common to both architectures and identify solutions that each architecture provides with respect to the other. Finally, to overcome some of these challenges, a new approach, stemmed in the context of the EU funded MLSysOps Project, is presented; the proposed approach utilizes agents and Machine Learning (ML) as-a-service to provide inbound and outbound intelligence in the system. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
	Pagliuca P.; Vitanza A.	N-Mates Evaluation: a New Method to Improve the Performance of Genetic Algorithms in Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems	2023	Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) are a widely used paradigm for modeling agents that interact with each other to solve problems. Genetic algorithms represent methods mimicking natural evolution and have been successfully applied in various domains, including MASs. While evolving controllers for homogeneous agents can be considered a relatively trivial task, evolving a collective ability in a group of heterogeneous agents strongly depends on the individual’s characteristics. In a genetic algorithm, the selection of the individuals forming the MAS is random and the evaluation of the group performance is affected by both the agent’s ability and the environmental complexity. Consequently, the emergent dynamics of the system can be highly unpredictable, and the success or failure of the MAS may be inaccurately evaluated. To mitigate the effect of chance, we proposed a novel technique - called n-mates evaluation - which allows for a better estimation of each individual’s effectiveness and its contribution to the final performance of the MAS. Results collected from three different cooperative benchmark tasks indicate that the proposed method is effective and outperforms a traditional genetic algorithm. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Towards a Multi-Level Explainability Framework for Engineering and Understanding BDI Agent Systems	2023	Explainability is more and more considered a crucial property to be featured by AI-based systems, including those engineered in terms of agents and multi-agent systems. This property is primarily important at the user level, to increase e.g. system trustworthiness, but can play an important role also at the engineering level, to support activities such as debugging and validation. In this paper, we focus on BDI agent systems and introduce a multi-level explainability framework to understand the system’s behaviour that targets different classes of users: developers who implement the system, software designers who verify the soundness and final users.

A Cognitive Approach to Model Intelligent Collaboration in Human-Robot Interaction	2023	While Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Social Robotics achieved significant results, research has not given the right attention both to the role of the analysis of cognitive processes by a robot and an extensive interpretation of intelligent collaboration, i.e robot adaptivity, trust, categorization, and so on. Daily life scenarios involving robots require a kind of collaboration oriented towards the respect and the achievement of the most relevant users goals, but also to the validation and protection of other application domains elements (e.g. other agents, available resources). To address this challenge, computational cognitive models are required, in order to integrate multiple users goals and interests within the interaction context and support robots to justify the integration process. In this theoretical paper, we propose a taxonomy, achievable although with certain constraints and occasional imprecision, of the human action intentions into three distinct classes: practical, socio-normative, and ethical. Building upon this premise, we outline the development of computational cognitive models aimed at supporting a useful, effective, acceptable and trustworthy interaction between humans and robots. While our conceptual framework is applicable across various domains, we will illustrate it with examples drawn from the domain of Cultural Heritage. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
	Costantini S.; Formisano A.; Pitoni V.	A Timed Epistemic Logic for Formalizing Cooperation among Groups of Agents	2023	In the multi-agent setting, it is relevant to model group dynamics of agents, and logic has proved to be an excellent tool. We have proposed in previous work an epistemic logic that allows one to formalize the new beliefs formed or removed by a group of agents, where several groups can co-exist and where an agent can pass from one group to another. A novelty introduced in this paper is that an agent can be lent by a (willing) group to another one in case of need. Another distinguished feature we introduce in this paper is time and temporal instants/intervals to express the time periods in which agents’ beliefs hold. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
	Messina F.; Santoro C.; Santoro F.F.	A Declarative C++ Agent Platform for Agent-based Edge Computing	2023	Software agents and multi-agent systems are pivotal in the development of distributed autonomous systems. While various agent platforms have been proposed, only a selected few are considered state-of-the-art. These agents exhibit a spectrum of intelligence, from reactive behaviours to advanced reasoning and planning. Integrating these capabilities within multi-agent systems enables distributed artificial intelligence, a programming paradigm where autonomous entities collaborate intelligently across a network to achieve common objectives. The advent of 5G technology is reshaping distributed systems, shifting computation towards the network’s edge. This transition has led to a proliferation of embedded devices with microcontrollers, known for low power consumption and not so ample computing resources. In this context, this paradigm aligns seamlessly with small cooperating entities dispersed throughout the network. However, providing agent platforms for embedded devices is challenging. Current state-of-the-art MAS platforms, mostly Java-based, pose concerns about memory and speed overhead for microcontrollers. Addressing these challenges, we introduce DEMOCLE, a multi-agent platform for embedded systems. DEMOCLE enables logic/declarative agent programming directly in C++, utilising object orientation, macros, and recent language features like lambdas. The runtime system is lightweight, incurring minimal overhead in both time and space. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of DEMOCLE, showcasing its features, advantages, and architecture. Additionally, it provides a practical application example. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
	Passeri M.; Agiollo A.; Omicini A.	Peer-Reviewed Federated Learning	2023	While representing the de-facto framework for enabling distributed training of Machine Learning models, Federated Learning (FL) still suffers convergence issues when non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data are considered. In this context, the local model optimisation on different data distributions generate dissimilar updates, which are difficult to aggregate and translate into sub-optimal convergence. To tackle this issues, we propose Peer-Reviewed Federated Learning (PRFL), an extension of the traditional FL training process inspired by the peer-review procedure common in the academic field, where model updates are reviewed by several other clients in the federation before being aggregated at the server-side. PRFL aims at enabling the identification of relevant updates, while disregarding the ineffective ones. We implement PRFL on top of the Flower FL library, and make Peer-Reviewed Flower a publicly-available library for the modular implementation of any review-based FL algorithm. A preliminary case study on both regression and classification tasks highlights the potential of PRFL, showcasing how the distributed solution can achieve performance similar to that obtained by the corresponding centralised algorithm, even when non-IID data are considered. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

A System for Tracking Patients in the Operating Room - A Pilot Study	2023	Operating Room (OR) management represents one of the most important processes in healthcare organizations. Inefficient scheduling and inefficient human allocation often negatively affect OR’s management processes. This pilot study aims to optimize the management of a generic operating block by automatically collecting data from a real surgical scenario. The final goal of the project will be the development of a new organizational model based on machine learning algorithms. Each patient is tracked and located in real time through an architecture that recognizes a wearable tag with a unique identifier. By exploiting indoor localization techniques, we can collect data about the time required by every step of the patient’s management process in operating block. The preliminary results are promising, times automatically recorded are much more precise than those collected by humans and reported in the organization’s information system. Moreover, machine learning methods can use historical data collection to predict the surgery time required for each patient according to their specific profile. This approach will make it possible to plan short and long-term strategies while optimizing the available resources. Finally, the integration of the IoT system with ML algorithms could contribute to the optimization of the operating block scheduling and will be the subject of further research. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Agents for Industry 4.0: the Case Study of a Production Cell	2023	In the era of Industry 4.0, where advanced technologies and interconnected systems are reshaping the landscape of manufacturing and production, the integration of intelligent automation and decision-making processes has become pivotal. One of the most promising paradigms to achieve this integration is through the use of multiagent Systems (MAS). In this paper we present a simulation environment for MAS that is based on a real-world production cell.

RMLGym: a Formal Reward Machine Framework for Reinforcement Learning	2023	Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique for learning optimal policies from trial and error. However, designing a reward function that captures the desired behavior of an agent is often a challenging and tedious task, especially when the agent has to deal with complex and multi-objective problems. To address this issue, researchers have proposed to use higher-level languages, such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL), to specify reward functions in a declarative and expressive way, and then automatically compile them into lower-level functions that can be used by standard RL algorithms. In this paper, we present RMLGym, a tool that integrates RML, a runtime verification tool, with OpenAI Gym, a popular framework for developing and comparing RL algorithms. RMLGym allows users to define reward functions using RML specifications and then generates reward monitors that evaluate the agent’s performance and provide feedback at each step. We demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of RMLGym by applying it to a famous benchmark problem from OpenAI Gym, and we analyze the strengths and limitations of our approach. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.
